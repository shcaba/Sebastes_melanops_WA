# Executive summary{-}

## Stock{-}

The assessments described in this document apply to the black rockfish (*Sebastes melanops*) stocks that reside in the waters from Point Conception (34\textdegree27' N latitude) in the south to the U.S. boundary with Canada (approximately 48\textdegree30' N latitude) through the year `r endyr`.  Following the consensus recommendations from a preliminary stock assessment workshop in April 2015 (PFMC 2015), the stock assessment team (STAT) decided to prepare separate geographic stock assessments that are spatially stratified with boundaries at the CA/OR border (42\textdegree00' N latitude) and OR/WA border (46\textdegree16' N latitude).  

Black rockfish are also caught from the waters off British Columbia and Alaska, but there have not been any formal assessments of stock status for those areas.

This assessment reports the status of `r spp` (_`r spp.sci`_) off Oregon state using data through `r endyr`. `r Spp` are also found in California (their core range) and Washington waters of the U.S. West Coast, and those are treated in separate stock assessments given different mangement considerations and exploitation histories. There is substantial biogeographic separation in the populations off Oregon and Washington, thus justifying separation of those populations into different management units and stock assessments.

## Removals{-}

Black rockfish are caught by a wide variety of gear types and in recent decades have been a very important target species for recreational charter-boats and private sport anglers in Washington and Oregon, and to a lesser extent in California.  In recent years the recreational fishery has accounted for most of the black rockfish catches (Figure ES-1 to Figure ES-3).  Black rockfish can also be an important component of nearshore commercial fisheries, either as incidental catch by the troll fishery for salmon or as directed catch by jig fisheries for groundfish.  Further, in California and Oregon there are nearshore fisheries that catch and sell fish live for the restaurant trade.  Washington closed nearshore commercial fisheries in state water in late 1990s and never allowed the live-fish fishery to develop. In all states there have been almost no trawl-caught landings of black rockfish in recent years (Table ES-1), but trawl landings in the past were substantial (Figure ES-1 to Figure ES-3).

Detailed reports of commercial landings of black rockfish are generally unavailable prior to 1981, when the Pacific Fishery Information Network (PacFIN) database began.  The catch series prior to 1981 for these assessments were derived by applying available estimates or assumed values for the proportion of black rockfish landings in reported landings of rockfish.  Observer data, which are available only for the past decade, indicate low levels of discarding of black rockfish, generally less than 2% of total catch.

Because of their nearshore distribution and low abundance compared to other rockfish species, black rockfish are unlikely to have ever comprised a large percentage of rockfish landings, but it seems quite certain that they have been more than a trivial component for many years.  Black rockfish were one of only four rockfish species mentioned by scientific name in reports of rockfish landings in Oregon during the 1940s, and they were one of only six rockfish species mentioned by scientific name in reports of rockfish landings in California during the same period. Mentions of black rockfish extend back before the year 1900 in Washington.

## Data and assessment{-}

The last stock assessments for black rockfish were conducted in 2007 for areas north and south of Cape Falcon (45\textdegree46' North latitude). The current assessments assume three areas instead of two, delineated by the state lines as was agreed upon at a pre-assessment and data workshop in March 2015. The prior assessments used Stock Synthesis 2, while the current assessments use Stock Synthesis 
```{r es-modelversion, echo=FALSE} 
if (exists("model")) {
  strsplit(model$SS_version,";")[[1]][1]
}
```
. The Washington base assessment includes a dockside and tag-based CPUE series, but does not include the abundance estimate time series from that same tagging study which was included in the last assessment due to too many violations in the assumptions of abundance estimation. The same two commercial and single recreational fleets are used as in the last assessment for Washington. The Oregon assessment has three commercial fleets and two recreational fleets, while using five surveys and an additional research study for biological compositions. California also has three commercial fleets and 1 recreational fleet with three surveys of abundance, all based on recreational fisheries. All area models include age data as conditional age at lengths. Length compositions are also included in all models.

The stock assessment for `r spp` off Oregon was developed using the length- and age-structured model Stock Synthesis (version 3.30.16).  No previous stock assessment for `r spp` off Oregon has been conducted. Model structure included two fleets (commercial and recreational) and one fishery-based index of abundance. Life history parameters were sex-specific (i.e., a two-sex model) with natural mortality and growth parameters estimated, along with recruitment.  The model covers the years `r startyr` to `r endyr`, with a 12 year forecast beginning in `r endyr + 1`.

This assessment integrates data and information from multiple sources into one modeling framework. Specifically, the assessment uses landings data, length and conditional age-at-length composition data (using ageing error matrices to incorporate ageing imprecision) for each fishery, and one index of abundance based on the recreational fishery; fixed parameterizations of weight-at-length, maturity-at-length, and fecundity-at-length, the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment steepness value and recruitment variability. Estimated values include initial population scale ($lnR_0$), natural mortality and growth for each sex, asymptotic selectivity and recruitment deviations. The base model was tuned to account for the weighting of the length and age data and index variances (which was estimated), as well as the specification of recruitment variance and recruitment bias adjustments.  Derived quantities include the time series of spawning biomass, age and size structure, and current and projected future stock status. 

Within model uncertainty is explicitly included in this assessment by parameter estimation uncertainty, while among model uncertainty is explored through sensitivity analyses addressing alternative input assumptions such as data treatment and weighting, and model specification sensitivity to the treatment of life history parameters, selectivity, and recruitment. A reference model was selected that best fit the observed data while concomitantly balancing the desire to capture the central tendency across those sources of uncertainty, ensure model realism and tractability, and promote robustness to potential model misspecification.

## Stock biomass and dynamics{-}

Spawning stock outputs are all at or above limit reference points (Table ES-2. Only California shows declines significantly below this reference point at any point in the time series. California and Washington stocks show a declining population through most of the 20th Century, with stronger declines in the 1980s, and recoveries beginning in the mid-1990s. Oregon stocks follow this pattern, but with a decline in the most recent period. California (33%) is below the target biomass reference point with an increasing biomass trend (Figures ES-4 and ES-5).  The Oregon stock dropped after the quick ramp up of catches in the late 1970s and continued a steady decline until around year 2000, settling in at a stock status around 60% of initial conditions. The Washington stock, currently 43%, dropped below the target biomass by in the early 1980s, then risen above since the late 1990s and has fluctuated above that point through 2014 (Figures ES-8 and ES-9).

Spawning output (in millions of eggs; meggs) instead of spawning biomass is used to report the mature population scale because fecundity is nonlinearly related to body female weight. The estimated spawning output at the beginning of 2021 was `r ssb_2021` meggs (~95 percent asymptotic intervals: `r ssb_2021_low` to `r ssb_2021_hi` meggs, Table \ref{tab:ssbES} and Figure \ref{fig:es-ssb}), which when compared to unfished spawning output (`r ssb0`) meggs gives a relative stock status level of `r round(100*depl_2021,0)` percent (~95 percent asymptotic intervals: `r round(100*depl_2021_low,0)` to `r round(100*depl_2021_hi,0)` percent, Figure \ref{fig:es-depl}).  Overall, spawning output declined with the onset of increasing commercial removals in the 1960s and continued to decline with the increase in recreational catches through the 1990s, even dropping below the target relative stock size. The largest of the estimated recruitment pulses since the mid 1990s (that are supported by each of the data sets) caused a sharp increase in spawning output through the mid 2010s, followed by another decline. The minimum relative stock size of `r round(100*as.numeric(depl_min),0)` percent of unfished levels is estimated to have occurred in `r depl_min_yr`. Currently the stock is estimated well above the management target of $SB_{40\%}$ in 2021 and is estimated to have remained above the target since 2000 (Table \ref{tab:ssbES} and Figure \ref{fig:es-depl}).

## Recruitment{-}

The California model shows a few extraordinarily high recruitment events that are supported by the length composition data, index data and on-the-water reports (Table ES-3; Figure ES-10).  Oregon recruitment is highly uncertain (Table ES-3; Figure ES11).  Washington recruitment is dynamic, but also shows the most informed recruitment time series, which is consistent with the extent of length and age compositions available to that assessment (Table ES-3; Figure ES12). Both California and Washington support elevated recruitment in the late 2000s.

Informative recruitment begins in the 1960s and peaks in the 1990s (Table \ref{tab:recrES} and Figure \ref{fig:es-recruits}). Data were most informative from the the 1990s to the mid-2010s. Peaks years of recruitments are found in years 1993, 1994, 1998, 2005 and 2015 (Figure \ref{fig:es-rec-devs}). Overall, the `r spp` stock has not been reduced to levels that would provide considerable information on how recruitment compensation changes across spawning biomass levels (i.e., inform the steepness parameter).  Thus, all recruitment is based on a fixed assumption about steepness ($h$ = 0.72) and recruitment variability ($\sigma_R$ = 0.6).

## Exploitation status{-}

California and Washington models indicate that current fishing practices are near or above the SPR rate fishing intensity target, while the Oregon model is quite a bit above the target (table ES-4, compare to SPR=0.5; Figure ES-13 to Figure ES-18), though the steepness value (0.773) indicates a much lower value of SPR for sustainable removals. Fishing rates have been above the target in California in nearly all years since the 1980s, but have dropped considerably in recent years. Oregon fishing rates have been consistently high in recent years.  Washington shows a dramatic decline in fishing intensity since the late 1990s and has fluctuated mostly below the target since. 

Trends in fishing intensity (1 - SPR) largely mirrored that of landings until the 1990s when recruitment pulses overcame the catches to lower overall fishing intensity (Figure \ref{fig:es-1-spr}). The maximum fishing intensity was `r spr_max` in `r spr_max_yr`, above the target SPR-based harvest rate of 0.50 (1 - $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$). Current levels of `r spr_recent_10[10]` for 2020 are near the fishing limit. Fishing intensity over the past decade has ranged between `r min(spr_recent_10)` and `r max(spr_recent_10)` and the exploitation rate has been high (`r min(exploit_recent_10)` - `r max(exploit_recent_10)`, Table \ref{tab:exploitES}). Current estimates indicate that `r spp` spawning output is much greater than than the target biomass level ($\text{SB}_{40\%}$), though fishing intensity remains near target $F_{MSY}$ proxy harvest rate.

## Ecosystem considerations{-}

This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, habitat factors or environmental factors into the assessment model. More predation, diet and habitat work, and mechanistic linkages to environmental conditions would be needed to incorporate these elements into the stock assessment. While no mechanisms have been put forth for these time-varying changes in growth, an environmental component is possible. Limited data in Oregon and California also suggest the possibility that growth has changed over time.

## Reference points{-}

Reference points were based on the rockfish FMSY proxy (SPR50%), target relative biomass (40%) and model-estimated selectivity for each fleet. California is below the target biomass reference point, but above the limit reference biomass (25%). Oregon is well above the target biomass.  Washington relative biomass is above the target biomass. California and Washington yield values are lower than the previous assessment for similar reference points due to lower overall natural mortality values (Table ES-5). The proxy MSY values of management quantities are the most conservative compared to the estimated MSY and MSY relative to 40% biomass for both California and Washington (Table ES-5). The equilibrium estimates of yield relative to biomass are provided in Figure ES-19 to Figure ES-21.

The 2021 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is well above the management target of 40 percent of unfished spawning biomass. The relative biomass and the ratio of the estimated SPR to the management target ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) across all model years are shown in Figure \ref{fig:es-phase} where warmer colors (red) represent early years and colder colors (blue) represent recent years.  There have been periods where the stock status has decreased below the target and fishing intensity has been higher than the target fishing intensity based on $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$. Figure \ref{fig:es-yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)` with vertical dashed lines to indicate the estimate of fraction unfished at the start of `r endyr +1` (current) and the estimated management targets calculated based on the relative target biomass (B target), the SPR target, and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY).

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model, `r endyr` (Table \ref{tab:e_ReferencePoints_ES}). Sustainable total yield, removals, using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ is `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 3, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` mt. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($\text{SO}_{40\%}$) calculated using the SPR target ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) was `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 4, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` meggs. Recent removals have been close to the point estimate of potential long-term yields calculated using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ reference point and the population size has been relatively decreasing toward the target over the past few years.

## Management performance{-}

Removals have been below the equivalent ABC-ACL since the prior assessment (Table ES-6), but those specified ABCs from the 2007 assessments are higher than those coming from the current assessment models. Removals over the last few years have or may have exceeded the newly estimated ABC-ACL values in some years. The differences in the treatment of natural mortality between the previous and current assessments are the biggest reason for this discrepancy.

Exploitation on `r spp` increased starting around 1960 and reached a high in the early 1990s. Since that time, catch has mostly fluctuated between 5 and 10 mt per year, with some years exceeding 10 mt, particularly in the last 4 years. The last ten years of the vermilion rockfish component acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limit (ACL) (which are equivalent) of the Minor Shelf Rockfish North Complex has been set, by definition, below the overfishing limit (OFL) (Table \ref{tab:ofl-es}). The `r spp` component OFL for this Complex has been exceeded by the Oregon removals in the most recent 4 years.

## Unresolved problems and major uncertainties{-}

The most significant uncertainty for all models is the treatment and value of natural mortality and the form of fleet selectivity (e.g., length-based asymptotic vs. age-based dome-shaped selectivity). Data-driven selection between the extreme “kill” (using a ramping of M) or “hide” hypotheses are not currently resolvable. The current California and Washington base models instead use a form of the “kill” hypothesis by not implementing the age-based selectivity (“hide” hypothesis) and estimating female and male natural mortality, thus avoiding a fixing natural mortality as was necessary in the Oregon model. The Oregon model also contained a step in female natural mortality, a specification not used in the California or Washington models. Another important issue is the highly uncertain historical time-series of removals in all states, which needs further consideration. The development of fishery-dependent indices of abundance still requires further attention. Steepness, while fixed, is still highly uncertain for rockfishes and currently is mismatched to the MSY proxy. And while the steepness profile shows low sensitivity in several derived quantities, steepness strongly defines the yield capacity of stocks, and therefore could cause major uncertainty in the recommended management quantities. Stock structure and its relationship to the current political/management boundaries are also not fully understood, both within U.S. jurisdiction and between the U.S. and Canada. While this is a common challenge faced in most west coast stock assessments, further improvement on this topic will likely rely on black rockfish-specific data.

## Scientific uncertainty{-}

The model-estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning biomass was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty around the OFL was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigm, 2)`. This is likely an underestimate of overall uncertainty because of the necessity to fix some parameters such as steepness, as well as a lack of explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty.

## Harvest Projections and Decision Table{-}

Black rockfish assessments for California and Washington have a preliminary distinction as category 1 stock assessments, thus harvest projections and decision tables are based on using P*=0.45 and sigma = 0.36, resulting in a multiplier on the OFL of 0.956. The Oregon black rockfish assessment is a category 2 assessment, with a P*=0.45 and sigma = 0.72 with a multiplier of 0.913 applied to the OFL.  These multipliers are also combined with the rockfish MSY proxy of FSPR=50% MSY and the 40-10 harvest control rule to calculate OFLs, ABCs and ACLs. Projections for each state are provided in Table ES-7 to Table ES-9. 

Uncertainty in management quantities for the base model of each state was characterized by exploring various model specifications in a decision table. Initial exploration included natural mortality and steepness values, and uncertainty in historical trawl catches for the WA and CA models. OR explored the scale factor coming from the value of the tagging catchability (Q) parameter, as well as M values. For the CA and WA models, there was very little sensitivity to steepness and trawl catches, but natural mortality produced sensitive results of predicted population scale and status. Discussion with the STAR panel resulted in high and low states of nature +/- 0.03 from the base case natural mortality values for females and males. High and low catch streams (rows) were determined by the forecasts, as described above, for each state of nature. Thus the low catch stream is based on the forecast from the low state of nature. The OR model demonstrated little sensitivity to M, but high sensitivity to the tagging survey Q. High and low states of nature, respectively, were based on a fixed tag of Q = 0.125 and Q estimated by the model. Resultant decision tables are provided in Table ES-10 to Table ES-12.

A ten year (2023-2032) projection of the reference model with removals in 2021 and 2022 provided by the Groundfish Management Team for each fleet under the category 1 (sigma=0.5) time-varying buffer using $P^*$ = 0.45 and 40-10 ABC control rule is provided in Table \ref{tab:project_ES}.

 \input{tex_tables/project_ES.tex}

The decision table (Table \ref{tab:es-dec-tab}) was constructed using female and male natural mortality to define the low and high states of nature. The multi-parameter likelihood profile was used to find the low (Female M = 0.07092; Male M= 0.06525) and high (Female M = 0.08527; Male M = 0.07845) female and male natural mortality values that produce -log likeliehood values  +0.66 units from the reference -log likelihood value. These correspond to the 12.5% and 87.5% quantiles (standard quantiles used in west coast decision tables). The catch rows in the table were based on three proposed catch streams:
  1. P* = 0.45, sigma = 0.5
  2. P* = 0.40, sigma = 0.5
  3. An equilibrium catch based on the $F_{MSY}$ proxy using SPR = 0.5.  

Across all states of natures and catch streams, vermilion rockfish relative stock size never falls below the target relative stock size of 40%. Both P* approaches lower the stock status from the high relative stock size values, while the $F_{MSY}$ proxy does not. The mismatch in the corresponding steepness value ($h=0.6$) that matches MSY at SPR = 0.5 with the steepness value in the stock assessment ($h=0.72$) that correpsonds to an MSY SPR of 0.35 explains why this constant catch will maintain the stock at very high relative stock status levels.

## Research and data needs{-}

Recommended avenues for research to help improve future black rockfish stock assessments:

1. Further investigation into the movement and behavior of older (> age 10) females to reconcile their absence in fisheries data. If the females are currently inaccessible to fishing gear, can we find where they are?
2. Appropriate natural mortality values for females and males. This will help resolve the extent to which dome-shaped age-based selectivity may be occurring for each.
3. All states need improved historical catch reconstructions. The trawl fishery catches in particular require particular attention. Given the huge historical removals of that fleet in each state, the assessment is very sensitive to the assumed functional form of selectivity. A synoptic catch reconstruction is recommended, where states work together to resolve cross-state catch issues as well as standardize the approach to catch recommendations.
4. Identifying stanzas or periods of uncertainty in the historical catch series will aid in the exploration of catch uncertainty in future assessment sensitivity runs. 
5. The ODFW tagging study off Newport should be continued and expanded to other areas.  To provide better prior information on the spatial distribution of the black rockfish stock, further work should be conducted to map the extent of black rockfish habitat and the densities of black rockfish residing there.
6. An independent nearshore survey should be supported in all states to avoid the reliance on fishery-based CPUE indices.
7. Stock structure for black rockfish is a complicated topic that needs further analysis. How this is determined (e.g., exploitation history, genetics, life history variability, biogeography, etc.) and what this means for management units needs to be further refined. This is a general issue for all nearshore stocks that likely have significant and small scale stock structure among and within states, but limited data collections to support small-scale management.
