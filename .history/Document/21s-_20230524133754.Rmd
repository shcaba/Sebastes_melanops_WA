## Fishery-Independent Data
### Abundance Indices
#### Nearshore Survey CPUE for Washington
Fishery-independent data available for this assessment came from two distinct WDFW research projects. The first was the Black Rockfish Tagging Program that was initiated in the early 1980s and provided CPUE of black rockfish captured for tag releases primarily off the central coast of Washington. The second data set was from the standardized Coastwide Rod-and-Reel Survey that began in 2019.  While technically independent from one another, these two fishery-independent data sources had comparable components allowing the data to be considered in two different ways. 
The Washington Black Rockfish Tagging Program was initiated in 1981 with the primary objective of collecting biological information such as growth and movement. The program continued through the 1980’s with modifications to protocols including scope, primary objectives, and tagging methods. Details of this extensive program can be found in Wallace et al. (2010).  Beginning in 1998, the geographic range of sampling was constrained, and effort was primarily focused on rocky habitats during spring months off the central coast of Washington in Marine Catch Area 2 (MCA 2).  Sampling crews consisted of 8-15 anglers using rod-and-reel rigged with one to three single hook jigs per line. During the sampling process, catches of black rockfish per angler minute were recorded, as were covariates month and MCA. Black rockfish were targeted during each trip. In 2010, the WDFW expanded the tagging program to include additional nearshore bottomfish species and increased the geographic disbursement of tags to the entire 180-mile-long Washington coastline. The program retained a primary objective of targeting black rockfish during the spring tagging efforts.

Tag release data collected from the Tagging Program were used for constructing abundance indices in all previous assessments for Black Rockfish off Washington coast. The 2009 stock assessment review panel considered tagging q as one of the major uncertainties due to the spatial coverage of the tag-release sites focusing mainly on central Washington coastal waters.  The 2015 Stock Assessment Review panel recommended future research to include definition and measurement of black rockfish habitat, the development of a coastwide fishery-independent survey for nearshore stocks, and improving CPUE standardization protocols (Advisors 2015).

Beginning in 2010, the WDFW started to address STAR panel comments and recommendations. In 2011, geographic coverage of the Tagging Program was expanded by adding more stations to the northern and southern coastal waters, while black rockfish remained the targeted species. In 2014, the WDFW decided to terminate the historical Black Rockfish Tagging Program and started to plan for a survey to include other nearshore groundfish species besides black rockfish, such as China, quillback, copper, lingcod, cabezon, and kelp greenling.  A series of pilot studies were initiated for site selection, gear testing, and survey timing. The culmination of these efforts from 2014-2018 was the standardized nearshore Coastwide Rod-and-Reel Survey which was initiated in 2019.  Since 2019, the WDFW has conducted an annual spring rod-and-reel survey targeting semi-pelagic bottomfish at 125 fixed stations (e.g., index stations) off the Washington coast.  At each station, 5 anglers deploy standardized fishing rigs consisting of 2 shrimp flies and drift over the rocky habitat 3 times.  Each drift is approximately 8 minutes long.  Details regarding sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology for this survey can be found in the Groundfish Subcommittee of the Science and Statistical Committee Visual-Hydroacoustic Survey Methodology Review and Hook-and-Line Survey Workshop details from September 2022 (Reference document??). 

For this assessment abundance indices using data from the two sampling programs described above were evaluated in two ways. First, data from the two projects were evaluated independently. The Black Rockfish Tagging Program tag release data were filtered for sampling events from 1998-2018 in MCA 2 during the spring months (March-July). This time series had the most consistent survey objectives and sampling protocols during the Program. Because black rockfish were explicitly targeted during these trips, no other filters were applied. Catch of black rockfish per angler hour was the response variable, which was an improvement from the past assessment, with covariates year and MCA. CPUE data analysis was done using a hurdle negative binomial regression model.  Figure XX. shows the abundance estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each year. The standardized nearshore Coastwide Rod-and-Reel Survey data were also analyzed using a hurdle negative binomial regression model for data from years 2019, 2021, and 2022.  Data from 2020 were excluded because only index stations in MCA2 were sampled prior to the survey being cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Covariates for these analyses included year, MCA, and depth. Figure XX. shows the abundance estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each year.

Secondly, data from the two projects were evaluated concurrently.  Because sampling for both projects targeted black rockfish using rod-and-reel methods on rocky habitats, CPUE data for black rockfish was combined.  Data were filtered for sampling only in MCA 2 during spring months.  Additionally, because of changes in survey designs from 2014-2018, only sets that were within 1km of any 1998-2013 central coast Tagging Program set in MCA 2 were included.  The 1km buffer eliminated most sets done on sand or areas that would not have been fished in a tagging objective set. The index calculation did not include a depth covariate as depth was not recorded during the Tagging Program sampling.  Data were analyzed using a hurdle negative binomial regression model for years 1998-2022 (no sampling occurred in MCA 2 in 2008 or 2017). Figure XX. Shows the abundance estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each year.

Model runs investigating the sensitivity to independent and combined indices for the fishery-independent research sampling projects were considered. Results of the sensitivity runs found……
