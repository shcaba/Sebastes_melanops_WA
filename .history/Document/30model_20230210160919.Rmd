### History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock

#### Black Rockfish South of Cape Falcon

The first stock assessment of black rockfish off Oregon [@stewart_status_1993], which was limited in geographic scope to the northern portion of Oregon, was a Cohort Analysis based on age composition data collected from fish landed at Garibaldi.  The first comprehensive analysis of the black rockfish stock off Oregon and California was by Ralston and Dick [-@ralston_status_2003], who developed a statistical catch-at-age model using Stock Synthesis.  Sampson (2007) used a similar model configuration and approach.

In the 2007 assessment model the data were organized into three basic gear-types (Hook-and-Line, Trawl, and Recreational), the data from Oregon and California were kept separate, and the tuning indices were recreational angler CPUE series based on the same or similar data sources (MRFSS for both states, ORBS for Oregon, and CPFV surveys for California).  Fishing effort was measured in terms of angler-days rather than the angler-hours metric used in the current California and Oregon regional assessment models.  The 2007 assessment used the ODFW tagging study estimates of black rockfish abundance off Newport as a relative abundance index.  Those data were unavailable for the 2003 assessment.  The 2007 assessment also used a juvenile rockfish pre-recruit index, which was unavailable for the previous assessment.

The landings data series in the 2007 assessment differed quite substantially from the series developed by Ralston and Dick for the 2003 assessment.  Neither of those assessments attempted to account for discards, instead assuming that discards were negligible.


#### Black Rockfish North of Cape Falcon

Three full assessments for black rockfish, conducted in 1994, 1999, and 2007, modeled the black rockfish population found in coastal waters between Cape Falcon, Oregon and north to the U.S./Canadian border [@wallace_status_1994; @wallace_status_1999; @wallace_status_1999; @wallace_status_2007].  There have been no update assessments for black rockfish resources.  

The 1994 assessment utilized a Stock Synthesis model configuration, with two auxiliary data sets as black rockfish abundance indicators, one based on tagging CPUE and one on based coastal recreational bottomfish directed effort [@wallace_status_1994].

Wallace et al [-@wallace_status_1999] constructed an assessment model by using the AD Model Builder software (ADMB; [@fournier_1997]) to assess black rockfish abundance.  Three key features of the 1999 model were (1) the parameterization of the expected catches at age, (2) the definitions of the sampling units for the different types of data inputs, and (3) the integration of tagging data explicitly.  The parameterization chosen mostly affected parameter bias whereas the sampling unit designation mostly affected estimator variance.  Both bias and variance were components of overall parameter uncertainty.  The parameterization and the sampling unit definitions were both designed to conform to the actual sampling protocol used, thereby propagating sampling uncertainty through to the final biomass estimates.

The 2007 assessment [@wallace_status_2007] employed Stock Synthesis 2.  Unlike the 1999 assessment, CPUE from the tag release trips and Petersen tagging study abundance estimates were included as relative abundance indices.

#### California, Oregon, and Washington Assessments

The 2015 assessment defined three distinct stocks for assessment. Each stock matched the state boundaries of California, Oregon and Washington. All assessments used the Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.24V. The Washington model had three fisheries (two commercial and one recreational) and considered two surveys. There were three primary data likelihood components for survey indices, lengths and ages. Fits to catches also contribute to the total likelihood, but is typically very small. The models was tuned using the Francis [-@francis_data_2011] method for biological compositions and added variance for survey indices. Mean weights were not tuned. Recruitment deviations were not estimated. Natural mortality was treated as constant for males and used a step function (with a breakpoint at age 10) for females that was also constant over years. Age-based dome-shaped selectivity in the ocean boat-based recreational fishery was also implemented for females.  

Results for the Oregon assessment of black rockfish in 2015 estimated stock status for that year at 60.4%, and never showed a decline below the target biomass. This assessment was highly constrained by the choice to treat the catchability of the tagging index as known, thus the uncertainty in the assessment is very low.


### Most Recent STAR Panel and SSC Recommendations

The STAR panel identified the following issues as sources of major uncertainty:

* Natural mortality, especially in females. There is no data to differentiate whether the missing older females are dying or are avoiding capture. The choice between using a constant (as used in the California and Washington assessments) or step function (used in Oregon) is also an point of uncertainty. 
* The level of cryptic biomass. This is a result of using dome-shaped selectivity to explain the absence of old females.
* Uncertainty in historical catch, especially in the historical trawl fishery.
* Acknowledging that there remains uncertainty in the stock-recruit relationship parameters (particularly the Beverton-Holt steepness parameter).

The Oregon model faced many challenges and ultimately was re-evaluated in a secondary review panel. That panel noted the following issues and recommendations (in addition to those above).

* The lack of recruitment estimation should be re-evaluated despite the last assessment indicating no apparent information contained in the biological data as to notable recruitment deviations. There was concern recruitment was being driven by catch rather than biological signals. 
* The tagging data q was fixed and strongly dictated scaling in the assessment. The tagging study data and subsequent constraint in q values needs further consideration.
* Continued ageing and age validation of black rockfish samples
* A fishery-independent nearshore survey was recommended


Most of the above recommendations were included in the 2015 assessment research recommendations. Additionally, stock structure for black rockfish was highlighted as a topic for further consideration.


# Model description


## Modelling Platform
Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 was used as the statistical catch-at-age modelling framework. This framework allows the integration of a variety of data types and model specifications. The SS-DL tool (https://github.com/shcaba/SS-DL-tool) was used for model exploration, likelihood profiling, and sensitivity analyses. The companion R package r4ss (version 1.38.0) along with R version 4.0.5 were used to investigate and plot model fits.
