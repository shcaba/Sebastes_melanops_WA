# Management 

## Reference Points

Reference points were based on the rockfish FMSY proxy ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$), target relative biomass (40%), and estimated selectivity and catch for each fleet (Table \ref{tab:ReferencePoints}). The `r spp` population in Washington at the start of 2023 is estimated to be just above the target biomass, and fishing intensity during 2022 is estimated to be just below the fishing intensity target (Figure \ref{fig:phase}). The yield values are lower than the previous assessment for similar reference points due to updated life history estimates and estimates of the total scale of the population, despite the overall stock status being a bit higher. The proxy MSY values of management quantities are by definition more conservative compared to the estimated MSY and MSY relative to 40% of unfished spawning output because of the assumed steepness value. Sustainable total yield, removals, using the proxy $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ is `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 3, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` mt. The spawning output equivalent to 40% of the unfished spawning output ($\text{SO}_{40\%}$) calculated using the SPR target ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) was `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 4, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` billions of eggs. 

Recent removals since 2017 have been at or below the point estimate of potential long-term yields calculated using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ reference point (Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}), leading to a  population that has continued to increase over recent years with the assistance of above average recruitment between 2003-2014, despite below average recruitment starting in 2015. The equilibrium estimates of yield relative to biomass based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)` are provided in Figure \ref{fig:yield}, where vertical dashed lines indicate the estimate of fraction unfished at the start of `r endyr +1` (current) and the estimated management targets calculated based on the relative target biomass (B target), the SPR target, and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). 

The 2023 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass, based on the 2022 fishing year, is `r 100*depl_curr`%, above the management target of 40% of unfished spawning output. The relative biomass and the ratio of the estimated SPR to the management target ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) across all model years are shown in Figure \ref{fig:phase} where warmer colors (red) represent early years and colder colors (blue) represent recent years.  There have been periods where the stock status has decreased below the target and limit relative biomass, and fishing intensity has been higher than the target fishing intensity based on $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$.

## Management performance

`r Spp` removals have been below the equivalent Annual Catch Limit (ACL) over the recent decade (Table \ref{tab:manage}). The ACL declined in 2017 relative to earlier years based on the 2015 assessment of `r spp` [@cope_assessments_2016]. In the last ten years, catches peaked in 2016 at 369 mt. Since then catches have declined to a recent low of 130 mt in 2020 with the catches in the final two model years remaining low with 197 mt in 2021 and 166 mt in 2022. The OFL has not been exceeded in any year over the past 10 years.


## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

The `r spp` assessment is being considered as a category 1 assessment with a $P^*$ = 0.45, $\sigma$ = 0.50, and a time-varying buffer applied to set the ABC below the OFL. These multipliers are also combined with the rockfish MSY proxy of SPR\textsubscript{50} and the 40-10 harvest control rule to calculate OFLs and ACLs. A twelve-year (2023-2034) projection of the reference model using these specifications along with input removals for 2023 and 2024 provided by the Groundfish Management Team (Katie Pierson, ODFW, pers. comm.) is provided in Table \ref{tab:project}. 

Uncertainty in management quantities for the reference model was characterized by exploring various model specifications in a decision table, with the desire for states of nature to represent uncertainty in both scale and relative stock status  Initial explorations considering alternative specifications of natural mortality. This was based on using the estimated $M$ scenario as a low state of nature and applying the sex-specific $M$ values from the 2023 Oregon model as the high state of nature. These produced wide states of nature (Figure \ref{fig:stateofnature_SO} and Figure \ref{fig:stateofnature_depl}). Discussion with the STAR panel led to defining two other states of nature based on the reference model uncertainty in ending spawning output. Low and high states of nature were determined by applying an initial recruitment ($lnR_0$) value that lead to current spawning output values equivalent to the 12.5% and 87.5% percentile values from the current spawning output distribution (Figure \ref{fig:stateofnature_SO} and Figure \ref{fig:stateofnature_depl}) that are not as widely spread as the initial states of nature, but are constructed from the current model specifications. The resultant decision table (Table \ref{tab:dec-tab}) was built around the initial $lnR_0$ states of nature approach. The catch rows assume P* values of 0.45 and 0.4, then a constant catch using the yield at FSPR=0.5.


## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The model-estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning biomass was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty around the OFL was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigm, 2)`. This is likely underestimate of overall uncertainty because of the necessity to fix some life history parameters such as natural mortality and steepness, as well as a lack of explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty. The alternative states of nature used to bracket uncertainty in the decision table assist with encapsulating model structure uncertainty.

## Research and Data Needs

This section briefly highlights progress on research and data needs identified in the most recent (2015) `r spp` assessment, and then provides recommendations for future research.

Research and data needs identified in the last assessment (italics) are listed here followed by a brief response for each.

\textit{Further investigation into the movement and behavior of older (> age 10) females to reconcile their absence in fisheries data. If the females are currently inaccessible to fishing gear, can we find where they are? This information is essential before another black rockfish assessment is undertaken.} Response: Work by ODFW, Rasmuson et al. [-@Rasmuson_noBOFFFs_2023], specifically looked at finding older female `r spp`. While this work was a step in the right direction, more hypothesis-drive work is needed to reconcile the fate of older females (thus this recommendation remains moving forward, see item 3 below).

\textit{Appropriate natural mortality values for females and males. This will help resolve the extent to which dome-shaped age-based selectivity may be occurring for each. This is a larger question on how to empirically estimate $M$ when direct measures are not available, which is usually the case.} Response: While natural mortality remains an unknown, this assessment does explore the estimation of $M$ using informed priors based on the Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_Mprior_2022] method. Research related to male and female $M$ remains a topic for further research (see item 4 below).

\textit{All states needed improved historical catch reconstructions. The trawl fishery catches in particular need particular attention. Given the huge historical removals of that fleet in each state, the assessment is very sensitive to the assumed functional form of selectivity. A synoptic catch reconstruction is recommended, where states work together to resolve cross-state catch issues as well as standardize the approach to catch recommendations.} Response: While work has been conducted to improve historical catch reconstruction for various fleets (much of which went into the updated catch time-series used in this assessment), there still is more work to do (see item 4 below).

\textit{Identifying stanzas or periods of uncertainty in the historical catch series will aid in the exploration of catch uncertainty in future assessment sensitivity runs.} Response: This has largely been addressed with recent historic catch reconstruction updates, though more specific exploration of certain time periods could be determined with more research (see item 5 below).

\textit{An independent nearshore survey should be supported in all states to avoid the reliance on fishery-based CPUE indices.} Response: The Washington nearshore survey, currently in its fourth years of data collection, directly addresses this issue (see item 1 below).

\textit{Stock structure for black rockfish is a complicated topic that needs further analysis. How this is determined (e.g., exploitation history, genetics, life history variability, biogeography, dispersal and movement, etc.) and what this means for management units needs to be further refined. This is a general issue for all nearshore stocks that likely have significant and small scale stock structure among and within states, but limited data collections to support small-scale management.} Response: This recommendation still stands and is included in future research recommendations (see item 6 below).


Recommended avenues for research to help improve future `r spp` stock assessments:

1. Continue to develop the nearshore fishery-independent survey, as the other available surveys provide week information for the trend in the population.
2. Improve understanding of broader ecosystem considerations within the context of `r spp` (and other nearshore species) management. Evaluate and develop linkages between `r spp` population dynamics and environmental, oceanographic, and climate variables.  In particular, develop multi-scale models (e.g., species distribution models) that can evaluate spatial patterns (e.g., multi-use areas or closures to fishing) and climate impacts (e.g., growth or distribution shifts) for vulnerable nearshore species. Utilize the growing body of ecosystem information available for the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, as exemplified in the PFMC Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) report. 
3. Continue work on the investigation into the movement, behavior or mortality of older (> age 10) females to further reconcile their absence in fisheries data. In particular, conduct genetics studies on fish observed off of the continental shelf (middle of the gyre and at sea mounts) to determine their association with the nearshore stocks. 
4. Continue to build evidence for appropriate natural mortality values for females and males. This will help resolve the extent to which dome-shaped age-based selectivity may be occurring for each.
5. Continued consideration of historical catch reconstruction, specifically where there are periods of uncertainty.
6. Stock structure for `r spp` is a complicated topic that needs further analysis. How this is determined (e.g., exploitation history, genetics, life history variability, biogeography, etc.) and what this means for management units needs to be further refined. This is a general issue for all nearshore stocks that likely have significant and small scale stock structure among and within states, but limited data collections to support small-scale management.
7. Conduct early life history studies that provide a better understanding of the ecology and habitats of `r spp` from settlement to age-1.
8. Simulation analyses or make a standard sensitivity exploration to examine circumstances in which options for treatment sex data for composition data are preferable under Option 1 or 2 treating them as separate or Option 3 treating them as combined and preserving sex ratio within samples.  Such studies should aim to provide criteria for their application to inform guidance in the PFMC’s Groundfish  Terms of  Reference and Accepted Practices documents.
9. Further evaluation of temporal and spatial variability in biological and functional maturity may facilitate accounting for uncertainty or help account for trends and identify drivers. Data informing the functional maturity ogive were collected during a period of extreme variability in ocean conditions and further examination of the drivers of variability observed may prove beneficial.
10. Compare trends in abundance and patterns of recruitment across species to examine commonalities, differences and their causes may help inform accounting for environmental determinants.
11. Explore how best to account for variance in catch history to help reflect the full degree of uncertainty in the assessment.
12. Re-examine  methods to generate estimates of abundance from the WDFW Tagging Program using approaches used for similar data sets from analogous studies in Oregon.
