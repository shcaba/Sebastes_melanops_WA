The STAT thanks everyone involved in the many years of data collection that support the analyses in the stock assessment. Thank you to Chantel Wetzel for reviewing and offering many great edits. Owen Hamel, Jim Hastie, John Budrick and Marlene Bellman also reviewed a pre-STAR draft. The STAT would also like to thank the STAR panel members for their comments and review. We acknowledge WDFW for providing the Black Rockfish photos used on the title page.
