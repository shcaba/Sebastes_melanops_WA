## Recreational Landings & Discards

The sport caught (recreational) fishery landings underwent a major reconstruction in the 2015 assessment. This reconstruction is largely maintained in the new assessment. The only update is the predictive dead discard to landings ratio was updated by including the years 2015-2022 to the already used 2002-2014 values. The addition of 8 years to the 13 years did not perceptibly change the relationship (i.e., was consistent with the previous relationship) used to estimate discards back in time. 


```{r, results = 'asis'}
add_figure(
  filein = file.path(dir, "plots", "Rec_comps_fig.png"), 
  caption = "Total removals (landings plus dead discards) for sport-caught black rockfish used in the 2015 versus those proposed in the 2023 assessment.",
  label = 'Rec_comps_fig')

```
