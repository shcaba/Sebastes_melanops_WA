# Indices of Abundance

## Fishery-Independent 

### California Cooperative Fisheries Research Program

California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP) is a survey that monitors groundfish populations in Californiaâ€™s network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and adjacent reference areas. The CCFRP survey began in 2007 sampling select areas in northern California. In 2017, CCFRP expanded sampling across California. A detailed summary of the program and available sampling data for copper rockfish can be found [online](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2022/05/f-3-attachment-5-california-collaborative-fisheries-research-program-data-availability-for-stock-assessments.pdf/).

TODO: Add table of positive observations by year and area for the CCFRP survey

### NWFSC Hook and Line Survey

TODO: Add figure of the NWFSC Hook and Line index from last assessment.

TODO: Add table of positive observations by year from the NWFS Hook and Line 

TODO: Add existing figure of observation location for copper rockfish in the NWFSC Hook and Line survey (e.g., inside vs. outside CCA)

### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) survey has been conducted across the West Coast annually since 2003 (there was no sampling conducted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The number of observations of copper rockfish by the NWFSC WCGBT survey are limited due to the sample gear (trawl) which is deployed on soft bottom substrate. A summary of the observations by this survey between 2003-2021 can be found [online](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2022/05/f-3-attachment-4-detailed-summary-of-available-data-to-support-west-coast-groundfish-stock-assessments-in-2023-electronic-only.pdf#page=111). The majority of observations of copper rockfish by the NWFSC WCGBT survey occurs south of Point Conception. The limited number of tows by year will prevented the calculation of an index of abundance. Additionally, observations using trawl gear may not be informative of population trends for rocky-habitat associated species such as copper rockfish. However, the collected biological data from this survey will be used to help inform growth.
