# Indices of Abundance

## Fishery-Independent 

* Historical Tag/release data (1983-2014; 2015-2019)
* NWFSC dive surveys. Nearshore SCUBA surveys in the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) were conducted between 2015 and 2022. These provide potentially two abundance measures of the population: 1) young-of-the-year recruitment index and 2) adult relative abundance.
