# Indices of Abundance

## Fishery-Independent 

* Historical Tag/release data (1983-2014; 2015-2019)
* NWFSC dive surveys (2015-2022). Nearshore SCUBA surveys conducted at 10 sites in the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS). These provide potentially two abundance measures of the population: 1) young-of-the-year recruitment index and 2) adult relative abundance. More details on the full analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/shcaba/Sebastes_melanops_WA/blob/main/Data/Nearshore%20Dive%20Survey/OCNMS-Black-Rockfish-Analysis.pdf).
