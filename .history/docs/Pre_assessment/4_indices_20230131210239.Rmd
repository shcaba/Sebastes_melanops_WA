# Indices of Abundance

The 2015 assessment included fishery-independent abundance indices based on tag-release CPUE data from the Black Rockfish tagging program from 1986-2014, and a fishery-dependent index based on recreational dockside fisheries data from 1981-2014. This assessment will again incorporate both fishery-independent and fishery-dependent abundance indices. 

## Fishery-Independent 

* Historical Tag-release data (1983-2018): Since 1986 a main goal of the Black Rockfish tagging program was to estimate abundance (Wallace et al 2010). The previous assessment incorporated tagging CPUE indices calculated by angler minute for tagging trips during the most consistent fishing time (spring), in Marine Area (MA) 2, where most of the fishing occurred from 1986-2014. These indices can be extended by including Black Rockfish targeted sampling surveys in spring months in MA2 from 2015-2018.
* Nearshore Coastal Rod-and-Reel Survey (2019-2022): In 2019, WDFW implemented an annual standardized nearshore rod-and-reel survey at 125 index stations off the Washington coast.  Survey results provide an adult relative abundance measure coastwide for Washington, however survey data from 2020 is truncated due to Covid-19. These data could be used to extend the tag-release survey, but would have to reduce its coverage to only one area (MA2), and thus would no longer be coastwide for Washington.
* NWFSC dive surveys (2015-2022): Nearshore SCUBA surveys conducted at 10 sites in the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS). These provide potentially two abundance measures of the population: 1) young-of-the-year recruitment index and 2) adult relative abundance. More details on the full analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/shcaba/Sebastes_melanops_WA/blob/main/Data/Nearshore%20Dive%20Survey/OCNMS-Black-Rockfish-Analysis.pdf). 

## Fishery-Dependent 

* Recreational Dockside Index (1981-2022): Recreational dockside fisheries data were used in the previous assessment for 1981-2014 (N=61,574). Data are available for this series from 1981 through 2022. In the 2015 assessment this data series was modeled with a delta-GLM approach using catch per angler-day by vessel, with recreational dockside data samples filtered using the Stevens-MacCall (2004) method. The updated index will fix an error in the calculation of the effort.

## Additional Items for Discussion

* Fishery-Independent Indices Items: The historical tag-release data series is long, however there is a large gap in the data from 1990 through 1997. Additionally, data prior to 1990 may not be as reliable as data in the latter part of the data series. Assessment authors are considering truncating the data to begin the index in 1998.
* Assessment authors have discussed combining data from the historical tag-release data series and the nearshore coastal rod-and-reel survey to extend the historical time series through 2022.  If this were done, the Washington coastwide nearshore rod-and-reel index would not be used for this assessment. Nearshore survey data would be limited to spring surveys in MA2 to standardize the data, but concerns have been raised about the prescriptive nature of the survey vs. the inconsistent fishing methods during historic surveys. 
* Fishery-Dependent Indices Items: Bag limits have changed for Black Rockfish over time. These changes may impact the index and recreational selectivity information.
