## Maturity and Fecundity

Maturity will follow the description for the Oregon maturity.

Fecundity-at-length based on Dick et al. 2017 that was assumed in the last assessment.

## Length-Weight

The length-weight relationship should be similar to that used in the 2015 assessment, though it will be updated samples in more recent years.


## Length-at-Age

Ages are expected to be completed in the next month and will be added to the previous ages in the 2015 assessment. These will be used to estimate growth outside and inside the model.

## Natural Mortality

Natural mortality was fixed in the 2021 assessments at a value of 0.108 yr^-1^ based on an assumed maximum age of 50 years. The maximum age was selected based on available age data collected within Oregon and Washington and literature values. The oldest aged observed was 51 years with two observations off of the coast of Washington and Oregon in 2019. This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of copper rockfish and was supported by the observed ages that had multiple observations of fish between 44 and 51 years of age.  

The input parameter value for natural mortality will be reconsidered within the 2023 assessments based on any new available age data. Additionally, the 2023 assessments will explore the ability to estimate natural mortality within the model and will conduct sensitivities and profiles to understand the information in the data on natural mortality and the impact of select values on the model estimates.
