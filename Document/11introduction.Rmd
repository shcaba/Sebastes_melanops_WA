# Introduction

This assessment report describes the stock of `r spp` (*Sebastes melanops*) off the Washington coast in U.S. waters, using data through 2022. The stocks of `r spp` in Washington, Oregon, and California waters are each modeled as separate stocks with the population estimates reported in stock-specific assessment reports (Figure \ref{fig:map}). This assessment does not account for populations located in Canadian waters or other areas off the U.S. West Coast and assumes that these southern and northern populations do not contribute to nor take from the population being assessed here. 

## Basic Information

`r Spp` are an important component of the recreational fisheries in the nearshore waters off central and northern California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as the non-trawl commercial fisheries in California and Oregon. They range as far north as Amchitka and Kodiak islands in Alaska and are considered uncommon south of central California [@love_rockfishes_2002].  

Previous assessments of `r spp` off Washington [@wallace_status_1999; @wallace_status_2007] describe a study of coastal `r spp` genetic structure using 10 sampled sites collected from northern California to southern British Columbia between 1995-97.  Results of that study support the notion of separate genetic stocks north and south of Cape Falcon.  However, a later study [@baker_genetic_1999] of `r spp` collected from eight sites along the northern Oregon coast concluded that `r spp` from north and south of Cape Falcon were genetically very similar.

A stock boundary line at the Columbia River seems reasonable for `r spp`, both because it is a state fishery management boundary and because the Columbia River plume is likely to be a natural barrier to the north-south exchange of `r spp` adults and larvae. Given the spatial resolution of the historical commercial fishery data, it is very problematic to estimate the catch of `r spp` taken north of Cape Falcon but south of the Columbia River.

During a preliminary workshop in April 2015 [@pfmc_safe_2015], it was agreed that the assessments for nearshore species should at a minimum be spatially stratified with boundaries at the California/Oregon border ($42^\circ$ N. latitude) and the OR/WA border ($46^\circ 16^\prime$ N. latitude).  Such a spatial stratification would be consistent with two ideas: (a) these nearshore species do not exhibit much adult movement and (b) exploitation and management histories have varied significantly among the three states.  Together these features would likely create appreciable state-to-state differences in age composition for each of the three species.  

At the same nearshore stock assessment workshop, it was agreed that recreational catch histories for the stocks of `r spp` should be assembled on the basis of port of landing rather than location of fish capture, even though fishing vessels landing their catches into a port in one state might have captured fish in waters off a neighboring state.

Accounting for location of capture is very problematic for recreationally caught fish and for commercial catches taken with non-trawl types of gear (e.g., hook-and-line), for which there are no or very limited logbooks that report fishing location.  For these regional assessments the commercially caught `r spp` were apportioned to assessment region based on the port of landing, with the exception of trawl caught fish landed into Astoria, OR.  Most of these fish were assumed to have been caught off Washington and most of the trawl landings into Astoria were therefore included with the catch history for the Washington assessment region.  Additional details are provided in the commercial landings section \ref{com-landings}.

## Life History

Adults tend to occur in schools over rocky structure at depths less than 40 fathoms, and sometimes feed actively on or near the surface.  They feed on a wide variety of prey including zooplankton, krill, mysids, sand lance, and juvenile rockfish, and are subject to predation by lingcod and marine mammals [@love_rockfishes_2002]. 

Although tagging studies have documented some individuals moving long distances (several hundreds of miles), the vast majority of recaptured individuals were found close to the areas of initial capture and tagging [@culver_1987;@ayres_tag_1988;@wallace_tag_2010;@starr_green_2007].  Results from a 2004-05 study off Newport, Oregon of 42 `r spp` implanted with acoustic tags indicated that all but seven fish remained within range of a 3 x 5 km array of acoustic receivers during one full year of monitoring and had relatively small home ranges that did not vary seasonally [@parker_etal_2007].  @green_starr_2007 report similar findings from a study in Carmel Bay, California of 23 acoustically tagged `r spp`. The extensive Washington state tagging study also supported low movements for most individuals, with some exceptional movements recorded [@wallace_tag_2010].

Like all members of the genus Sebastes, `r spp` have internal fertilization and bear live young approximately two months after insemination. `r Spp` are quite fecund, with a six-year-old female annually producing about 300,000 embryos and a 16-year-old producing about 950,000 embryos [@bobko_berkeley_2004].  Recent studies have demonstrated that the relative number and quality of larvae increase with age in female `r spp` [@berkeley_etal_2004; @hixon_etal_1987]. Parturition of larvae occurs during winter [@wyllie_echeverria_1987] and larvae and small juveniles are pelagic for several months to a year [@boehlert_yoklavich_1983].  Settlement occurs in estuaries, tide-pools, and in the nearshore at depths less than 20 m [@stein_hassler_1989].  

`r Spp` begin recruiting to nearshore fisheries at 3-4 years of age, corresponding to a fork length of about 25-30 cm, and 50% of females attain maturity between 6-8 years of age, corresponding to a fork length of about 38-42 cm.  Adult female `r spp` grow 3-5 cm larger than males, with a few females attaining fork lengths greater than 55 cm.

## Ecosystem Considerations

No formal ecosystem considerations have been made given the lack of data for such an undertaking. Differences in growth though time have been considered in the model specification in the Washington model. Though the mechanism is not specified, this could certainly be due to process error driven by environmental conditions.

## Historical and Current Fishery Information

`r Spp` are harvested by a wide variety of fishing methods including trawling, trolling, and hook-and-line fishing with jigs and long-lines since at least the 1940s.  Although `r spp` have never been a dominant component of any commercial fisheries, they have been important incidental catch in the troll fishery for salmon and the troll and jig fisheries for groundfish.  With the decline of salmon fishing opportunities in the late 1970s and early 1980s `r spp` became a vital target of marine recreational fisheries in Oregon and Washington, especially during periods of restricted or slack fishing for salmon, halibut, and tuna.  

Since 1990 annual recreational harvests of `r spp` have averaged 272.5 tons off Washington. Commercial annual harvests by non-trawl gear types during the same period averaged 14.7 tons in Washington. Harvests by trawl on average during this period have been very low (Table \ref{tab:total_removals}).


## Summary of Management History and Performance

Regulation of the `r spp` fisheries by the PFMC prior to 2004 was accomplished primarily by trip limits for commercial fisheries and bag limit restrictions for recreational fisheries, with different limits applying in different geographic regions (see Table 1 in @ralston_status_2003).  Some other important regulations include the following:

* 1995: The commercial hook-and-line fishing in Washington state waters (0-3 miles) was closed to preserve recreational fishing opportunities and avoid localized depletion; the closure was extended to trawlers in 1999.  
* 2003: The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) established Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) to control catches of overfished rockfish species, and large portions of the shelf were closed to fishing. Differential trip limits were applied north and south of a management boundary at $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude for nearshore Sebastes species. 
* In 2008 the groundfish trawl fishery was closed in Washington from the seaward RCA boundary to the shore north of $48^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude to address increased encounters with Yelloweye Rockfish and Canary Rockfish.

In recent years regulations for the marine sport fisheries, which has been the major source of mortality on `r spp`, have become quite complicated and variable through time.  Tools for regulating the sport fishery include closed areas, depth restrictions, seasonal closures, and bag limits.

Washington had a recreational daily bag limit for rockfish (all species) of 15 fish per day from 1961 to 1991, 12 fish per day from 1992 to 1994,  10 fish per day from 1995 to 2016, and 7 fish per day from 2017 to 2022.  The bag limit for blue rockfish plus `r spp` in Marine Area 4B (Neah Bay) has been 6 fish per day since 2010.  Fishing seasons for groundfish species are structured to provide year-round fishing opportunities, if possible.  Depth restrictions vary by state management area, being more restrictive in the north compared to the south due to higher encounter rates with overfished Yelloweye Rockfish and Canary Rockfish (declared rebuilt in 2015).  There is no minimum size limit for `r spp`.

`r Spp` removals have been below the equivalent Overfishing Limit (OFL) and Annual Catch Limit (ACL) over the recent decade (Table \ref{tab:manage}).In the last ten years, catches peaked in 2016 at 369 mt and have since declined.

## Canadian and Alaska fisheries
`r Spp` is one of multiple Inshore Rockfish species on the West Coast of British Columbia. The most recent evaluation was completed by Yamanaka and Lacko [-@yamanaka_inshore_2001], which determined that there was insufficient information to recommend a `r spp`-specific catch quotas for the five management areas on the Pacific coast of British Columbia. `r Spp` continues to be a "Non-Quota" species in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Management Plan [@dfo_fmp_2014]. 

Directed fisheries for `r spp` in Alaska are limited. In the Westward region (Kodiak area) of Alaska, an acoustic visual survey has been the primary management tool used to determine population size. An age-structured assessment for `r spp` is under development by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game that will use the data from this acoustic visual survey as the primary data source. Assessments are also under development for `r spp` for the Southeast or Central regions in the Gulf of Alaska.
