# Data and Model Inputs

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current
assessment model. Descriptions of each data source included in the model (Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}) and
sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below. Data
that were excluded from the base model were excluded only after being explicitly explored
during the development of this stock assessment and found to be inappropriate for use or
had not changed since their past exploration for previous `r spp` stock assessments
when they were not used.
