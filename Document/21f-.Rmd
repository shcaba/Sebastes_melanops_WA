## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial

#### Landings

The systems along the U.S. West Coast for monitoring commercial fishery landings in the past did not keep track of the landings of individual rockfish species, largely because many rockfish species have similar market characteristics and therefore were landed as an unsorted mix of species. `r Spp` in particular, which are a nearshore species and much less abundant than many of the offshore rockfish species, were generally landed in mixed-species categories and not required to sort into its own market category until 2006. As a consequence, the historical records do not provide a detailed accounting of the landings of `r spp`. The basic approach taken to develop the landings series in this assessment, as in past assessments, was to apply values for the proportion of `r spp` sampled in mixed-rockfish landings. Data on the proportions of `r spp` are sparse, with the consequence that the landings reconstructions are highly uncertain.

Commercial fishery landings of `r spp` in Washington are compiled from a variety of sources including PacFIN, agency reports, historical fish ticket information and communication with agency personnel (Table \ref{tab:allcatches}). Since 1935, commercial fishing vessels have been required to submit a fish receiving ticket ("fish ticket") for each landing. Rockfish landings from domestic fishers are usually reported in mixed-species market categories, and are routinely sampled for species composition by port samplers.  The information required on the ticket and sampling methods have changed through time. Due to these changes, we separated the data into three time periods 1935-1969, 1970-1980, and 1981-present based on the level of detail available in the data for compiling landing history in Washington for this assessment. Comparisons of the commercial catch in each fishery for the current and previous assessments were conducted and shown in Figure XXX.

##### Years 1935 to 1969

Although the original paper fish tickets are no longer available for this period, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) recently digitized the daily aggregated data from printed reports, to assist in reconstructing the commercial groundfish fishery landings history for Washington.  These daily aggregated data reports contain summaries of daily catches for port-groups by gear and area fished.  The data are available for 1935 and for 1949-1969, and were used as the basis for the `r spp` catch reconstruction for this time period. 

During this period, mixed-species, nominal market categories were typically used for reporting of the aggregated data.  Market categories such as "red rockfish", "`r spp`" (BLK1), and "unidentified rockfish" (URCK) are typical on fish tickets during this time, lumping all red colored fish and black colored fish into these categories for reporting.  For bottom trawl gears, the BLK1 market category consisted of mostly yellowtail rockfish and silvergrey rockfish (Greg Lippert, pers. comm.).  To split the `r spp` landings out of the BLK1 market category, we assumed 10% of the BLK1 landings were `r spp` (BLCK). We further assumed that no other nominal market categories in the trawl fishery contained `r spp` (Table XXX). 

For the commercial jig and troll fisheries, rockfish were landed in the unidentified rockfish (URCK) market category. No species composition samples are available during this time, so we assumed 85% of URCK landings were `r spp`, which matches the species composition data from the 1985-1989 commercial jig fishery. These estimates were also supported by interviews with port samplers active during portions of this period.  The rockfish caught by troll gears composed of mostly yellowtail rockfish and `r spp`.  Wright [-@wright_1967] reported rockfish species composition of the troll landings by port.  We assumed 80% of URCK caught off central Washington were `r spp`` and 20% for northern Washington landings.  


#####  Years 1970 to 1980

Original fish ticket data were used for commercial catch estimate during this period. Fishing areas were better defined and reported during this period; there were no longer interstate areas due to the introduction of current management areas, with a boundary line at the Oregon/Washington state border.  However, issues with URCK market category remained.  Species composition sampling of URCK were conducted for trawl and jig fisheries but not for salmon troll and the "other gears" gear types. 

To estimate the trawl landings of `r spp` in the category URCK, we applied the current WDFW species composition algorithm by gear, port, and quarter.  If no species composition samples were taken during a quarter, we first borrowed annual composition data for the gear/port group. If those data were not available, a coastwide annual composition for the particular gear type was applied.  There was no borrowing of composition information across gear groups or years.

The commercial jig fleet operates in nearshore waters and `r spp` is the dominant component of the URCK landing for this gear type.  Species composition sampling was not conducted during the 1970-1980 time period.  Based on the samples collected in the 1980s, we assumed that `r spp` made up 80% of the total rockfish landed by the jig fleet.  For the troll fishery, the same proportions as for the pre-1970 time period were applied.

Rockfish (URCK) were also landed in small amounts by other commercial fleets, such as fixed gears and salmon troll.  The fleets in the 1970s and 1980s predominantly targeted sablefish and Pacific halibut in waters too deep for `r spp`.  Port samplers did not recall observing any `r spp` in the fixed gear landings (James Beam and Greg Lippert, pers. comm.).  Therefore, we assumed fixed gear landings were negligible.  For URCK landed by the salmon troll fleet, the majority of troll landings was yellowtail rockfish with smaller numbers of widow rockfish, canary rockfsihâ—‹, and `r spp` (Wendy Beeghley and James Beam, pers. comm.). We assumed that 10% of the troll rockfish landings were `r spp` for 1970-1980.  


##### Years 1981 to the Present (the PacFIN era)

Commercial landings data for the modern era (1981 to present) are taken from the Pacific Fishery Information system (PacFIN), which is a central repository for U.S. West Coast groundfish landings and auxiliary information collected by the three state fishery agencies and other agencies. A description of basic state data collection systems and overview of PacFIN is provided in @sampson_commercial_1997.  Updated dockside sampling protocols and data processing procedures for Washington are described in Tsou et al. [-@tsou_etal_2015] and Tsou and Weyland [-@tsou_weyland_2015].  Rockfish landings from this period are pulled from the PacFIN comprehensive catch table. Landings in this table are the products of nominal landings, as well as area and species compositions. For the remaining URCK in this table, we applied a coastwide annual composition for each gear, as described above. After this step, there were still small amounts of URCK for trawl and setline gears. These landings are not included in this assessment. 

For the jig-gear fishery, dockside sampling was conducted by the WDFW Ocean Sampling Program (OSP) during 1985-1991. These species composition data are not available in PacFIN. For landings during 1985-1991 the URCK species compositions were stratified by year and port. For other years, species compositions were stratified by port only.  For jig-caught fish landed into Seattle annual species compositions from Neah Bay were applied because there was no port sampling in Seattle.
The URCK market category was used until 2000, after which it was replaced by the Slope, Shelf, and Nearshore rockfish market categories.  The commercial nearshore fishery was closed in 1999, so starting in 2000 there are negligible `r spp` landings in any market categories. In 2005 mandatory sorting was established for `r spp`, so all `r spp` landed should be recorded on fish tickets in the BLK1 category.

To assign URCK commercial salmon troll landings, we used the same reasoning assumption as applied to earlier periods (see 1970-1980) to assign 10% of the URCK landed in the salmon troll fishery to `r spp`. After a complete nearshore commerical fishery closure in 1999, `r spp` landings have been negligible.

It has been and continues to be a common practice for Oregon fleets to fish off Washington coast and land the catches at Oregon ports. Although the separate geographic assessments by state region would ideally have strict geographic separation of landed catch to the location of capture, this is not possible to accomplish because information on the fishing location is generally unavailable. Until recently logbooks that report area of capture were only available for landings by the groundfish trawl fleet. Oregon has required a logbook for commercial vessels participating in its nearshore fishery since 2004.  

Staff from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) used species composition samples collected during 1976 to 1993 to conduct an analysis of the spatial distribution of `r spp` landed at Astoria, Oregon.  Astoria is the northernmost port in Oregon and is located near the mouth of the Columbia River, which forms the boundary between Oregon and Washington.  The portion of aggregated rockfish landed pounds that were taken north of the Columbia River (i.e., from waters off Washington) was 98.6%.  This percentage was applied to all historical trawl landings of rockfish at Oregon's Columbia River District ports prior to 1976. It was assumed 14.1% of the aggregated rockfish being Black in the 2015 assessment [@cope_assessments_2016]. This percentage is much higher than the values used for Washington catch reconstruction. Therefore, we recalculated the portion by using Washington historical species composition data not available in PacFIN for pre-1981 and data available in PacFIN for 1981 to 1986. The revised proportions of `r spp` in the aggregated rockfish landings are 3% and 4% for pre-1981 and 1981-1986, respectively.  Non-trawl landings into Astoria were assumed to have been caught from Oregon waters, same assumption as used in 2015 assessment.  

Starting in 1994 `r spp` landed into Oregon were legally required to be sorted and sold in a separate `r spp` market category and were also reported as separate retained catches in the mandatory trawl logbooks. Based on the retained catches reported in the logbooks, the estimated proportion of the trawl-caught `r spp` that were caught from off Washington and landed into Astoria ranged from 65 to 100 percent. These `r spp` are accounted for in the Washington regional assessment.

The WDFW provided commercial fishery landings based on fish ticket records of `r spp` harvested off Oregon by vessels landing at ports in Washington.  Landings were less than 1 mt per year for the period 1971 to 2014; therefore, all landings to Washington ports were assumed to occur in waters off Washington in this assessment.


#### Foreign Fishery Catches of `r spp`

Rogers [-@rogers_species_2003] developed catch reconstructions for removals by foreign trawlers operating off the U.S. West Coast during the late 1960s to mid-1970s. Although this study reports that Japanese vessels operating in the Columbia and Eureka statistical areas (Oregon and northern California) caught substantial amounts of `r spp`, with cumulative catches of more than 500 mt over 10 years, it seems very unlikely that foreign vessels could have operated sufficiently close to shore to catch appreciable amounts of `r spp`. This assessment does not include Rogers' [-@rogers_species_2003] estimates of foreign fleet removals of `r spp`. 


### Recreational Removals

The Washington recreational catch history of `r spp` was reconstructed using several direct and indirect records of `r spp` catch (Table \ref{tab:allcatches}). All primary sources report catch in numbers of fish. As sources have been modified and re-evaluated, a completely new catch reconstruction for Washington was developed for 2015 assessment. This catch history was updated to include 2015-2022 estimates in this assessment. Comparisons of the catch in each recreational fishery for the current and previous assessments are in Figure X.


### Estimated Discards

In the previous assessment, commercial discards were not accounted for due to the information provided by the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) at that time, showing about a 1% discard rate in their survey.  We evaluated the WCGOP estimates of `r spp` discards from 2002-2013, which showed a total of 32.2 mt in estimated discards and total landings of 2042.5 mt coastwide, resulting in a rough discard rate estimate of 1.58%.  This amount of discards was included in the California hook and line non-live fishery landings, going back to 1916, and in the Oregon hook and line non-live fishery landings to 1892. Given the minimal amount of discards, no further depth-dependent mortality estimates were evaluated for Oregon and California and this discard rate was added to the total commercial removals.  -@parker_buoyancy_2006 concluded that semi-pelagic, vertically mobile species, such as `r spp`, show less barotrauma; hence these estimates could be slightly overestimated.  

Washington recreational discard estimates were not available until 2002.  Numbers of discarded-by-depth `r spp` were estimated using the same catch expansion algorithm for landed catch. Surface release mortalities adopted by the Groundfish Management Team (GMT) in their death-by-depth matrix (11%, 20%, 29%, and 63%) were then applied to the number of release `r spp` for each of 4 release depth bins (0-10 fathoms [fm], 11-20 fm, 21-30 fm, and >30fm), respectively. Total dead released `r spp` were then summed across each depth bin. The average weights of discards were assumed to be the same as the average weights of landed and multiplied by the number of released dead to get total dead in metric tons.  For pre-2002 release, proportions of releases based on a ratio estimator using 2003-2007 data were applied.  For the split between recreational charter and private vessels, the same algorithm used for splitting retained catch was applied. The overall average discard rate in the recreational fisheries was 1.37%. There was no information on Washington commercial discards, so the rate of 1.37% (same as the historical recreational discards) was also applied to the entire commercial time series. This low rate was similar to discard rates estimated in the other states.


## Size and Age Composition Data

Fish length measurements, primarily from the recreational fishery, are one of the major sources of data for this assessment.  



### Length and Age Sample Sizes

The level of commercial fishery sampling for `r spp` has been erratic, with almost no samples taken in Washington until the early 1990s (Figure X).  


#### Multinomial Sample Sizes

Initial input values for the multinomial samples sizes determine the relative weights applied in fitting the annual composition data within the set of observations for each fishery.  The initial input values in this assessment were based on the following equation developed by I. Stewart and S. Miller (NWFSC), and presented at the 2006 Stock Assessment Data and Modeling workshop. The input sample sizes for all commercial data were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

Tuning of the assessment model involved multiplying the input sample sizes for each fishery by an adjustment factor to achieve a better balance between how well the model fit the set of composition data and how well it should have fit the data given the sample sizes underlying the data.


#### Length Compositions

The length data for the assessment model were tabulated into 2-cm length bins ranging from 10 cm to 64 cm, with accumulator bins at each end. 

The length composition data indicate some general differences between the three fishery types, with the trawl fisheries producing the largest fish, the recreational fisheries producing the smallest fish, and the non-trawl fisheries producing fish of intermediate length.  There is little evidence in any of the length composition data of distinct modes or successions of modes from one year to the next that might represent strong year-classes.



##### Washington Length Compositions

###### Commercial

The biological data for the commercial fishery were extracted from PacFIN on April 24th, 2015.  These data are from trawl and non-trawl (hook-and-line) fisheries; there is no live-fish fishery off Washington. Of the 9,009 records available within PacFIN (each representing a single specimen), 4,989 were from the commercial trawl fishery (Table X).

Length composition data are reported either in fork length or total length. Fork lengths are preferred; where they are missing the total length is used. These data are expanded to reduce the effect of non-uniform sampling effort (Table X). The expansions are by weight, catch/sampled catch; first on a per-trip level, and then on a per-year, per-fishery level.  Expansion factors have a minimum value of 1, and are capped at their 90th percentile value. The final sample size is the product of the two expansion factors, which is then capped at its 90th percentile value.  The final sample sizes for the Washington biological data ranged from 1 to 389.7, with a median value of 10.4.  

The data were stratified by gender and fishery.  The final sample sizes were stratified and summed by length bin (10 cm to 64 cm bins, 2 cm in width), and an effective sample size is computed from the number of trips and number of fish each stratum represents, according to the Stewart and Miller method for multinomial fishery data. Unsexed fish were treated as above, but entered as a separate dataset.


###### Recreational

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife biological database provided sampled length data from the recreational fishery for sexed and unsexed samples for years 1979-2014. Sexed samples were the largest sample sizes and covered most years (Table XX). Composition data were used as collected (i.e., not expanded). Effective sample sizes were based on unique "sequence" sizes, which is roughly equivalent to a trip. 


##### Tagging data

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife provided sampled length data from the tagging survey for sexed and unsexed samples for years 1981-2014 (Table XX). Unsexed and sexed data were generally available in different years. Like the recreational data, composition data were used as collected (i.e., not expanded) and effective sample sizes were based on unique "sequence" sizes, which is roughly equivalent to a trip. 


#### Age Compositions

Commercial age composition data were a subset of the length data, 7984 records in total, and were expanded in the same manner as the lengths (Table XX).  Ages were stratified by fishery and gender, and binned in 1-year bins from 0 to 45, with additional bins 50 and 55.  As for the length compositions, the unsexed fish (29 samples) were treated as a separate dataset.  Samples were also available by sex for several years in the recreational data (Table XX).

Age-at-length compositions were not expanded; the final sample sizes were the sum of all individual age samples per length bin. For all three models, the ages were modeled as conditional age-at-length.


### Abundance Indices

Age and length composition data by themselves do not provide sufficient information to reliably determine trends in stock abundance and biomass.  Most assessments of U.S. West Coast groundfish stocks rely on estimates of stock biomass from research trawl surveys to provide information on biomass trends, but `r spp` are very infrequently caught in any of the bottom trawl surveys, which have a limited coverage of shallow nearshore waters (none of the surveys have ever been conducted in waters shallower than 55 m).  

#### Dockside catch-per-unit-effort for Washington

The WDFW provided recreational dockside fisheries data from 1981 through 2022 for consideration in this assessment. Data were collected at the trip level, with the number of landed fish and the number of anglers on each vessel being recorded. The amount of time fished by each angler was not recorded. This data had also been provided for the 2015 `r spp` Assessment where authors used the Stephens-MacCall method [@stephens_multispecies_2004] as an objective approach for identifying trip records of catch/effort data, and several covariates including year, month, boat type, area, daily bag limits and depth restrictions. For the 2015 Assessment data were modeled using a delta-GLM approach, where the catch occurrence (binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the positive catch component was modeled using either lognormal or gamma distributions. 

The recreational dockside data was considered for use in this assessment, however, management measures implemented over the past several decades impeded extracting a reliable signal for use as abundance indices. In 2003, management restricted summer fishing depths to shallower than 20-fathoms in WDFW marine areas 3 and 4, and in 2006 modified this depth restriction to 30-fathoms in marine areas 2, 3, and 4. Additionally, daily rockfish limits were 15 fish from 1981-1991, 12 fish from 1992-1994 (except in area 1 where it remained at 15), 10 fish from 1995-2016, and a reduction to 7 fish from 2017-2022. The effects of these management changes to CPUE of `r spp` could not be reconciled with changes in the abundance indices and therefore this dataset was not used in this assessment.
