## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Removals

#### Landings

The systems along the U.S. West Coast for monitoring commercial fishery landings in the past did not keep track of the landings of individual rockfish species, largely because many rockfish species have similar market characteristics and therefore were landed as an unsorted mix of species.  Black rockfish in particular, which are a nearshore species and much less abundant than many of the offshore rockfish species, were generally landed in mixed-species categories and were not required to be sorted into its own market category until 2006.  As a consequence, the historical records do not provide a detailed accounting of the landings of black rockfish.  The basic approach taken to develop the landings series in this assessment (as in past assessments) was to apply values for the proportion of black rockfish sampled in mixed-rockfish landings.  Data on the proportions of black rockfish are sparse, with the consequence that the landings reconstructions are highly uncertain.

Since 1935, commercial fishing vessels have been required to submit a fish receiving ticket ("fish ticket") for each landing.  Rockfish landings from domestic fishers are usually reported in mixed-species market categories, but were not routinely sampled for species composition by port samplers until 2000.  The information required on the fish ticket and sampling methods have changed through time. A historical catch reconstruction for black rockfish was conducted for the 2015 black rockfish stock assessment (Cope et al. 2016). We keep the same catch history and updated the total removal time series to 2022 (Table 1).  

It has been and continues to be a common practice for Oregon fleets to fish off the Washington coast and land their catches in Oregon ports. Although the separate geographic assessments by state region would ideally have strict geographic separation of landed catch to the location of capture, this is not possible to accomplish because information on the fishing location is generally unavailable.    Beginning in 2004, Oregon required a logbook for commercial vessels participating in its nearshore fishery.  
To account for the black rockfish removed from Washington water by Oregon fleets historically, staff from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) used species composition samples collected during 1976 to 1993 to conduct an analysis of the spatial distribution of black rockfish landed at Astoria, OR.  Astoria is the northernmost port in Oregon and is located near the mouth of the Columbia River, which forms the boundary between Oregon and Washington.  The portion of aggregated rockfish landed pounds that were taken north of the Columbia River (i.e., from waters off Washington) was 98.6%.  This percentage was applied to all historical trawl landings of rockfish at Oregon's Columbia River District ports prior to 1976. Of the 98.6% of aggregated rockfish landings, it was assumed 14.1% was black rockfish in the 2015 assessment (Cope et at. 2016). This percentage is much higher than the values used for the Washington catch reconstruction. Therefore, we recalculated this portion by using Washingtonâ€™s historical species composition data which is not available in PacFIN for pre-1981 and data available in PacFIN for 1981 to 1986. The revised proportions of black rockfish in the aggregated rockfish trawl landings are 3% and 4% for pre-1981 and 1981-1986, respectively.  Non-trawl landings into Astoria were assumed to have been caught from Oregon waters, which is the same assumption used in the 2015 assessment.  

Starting in 1994 black rockfish landed into Oregon were legally required to be sorted and sold in a separate black rockfish market category and were also reported as separate retained catches in the mandatory trawl logbooks.  Based on the retained catches reported in the logbooks, the estimated proportion of the trawl-caught black rockfish that were caught from off Washington and landed into Astoria ranged from 65 to 100 percent. These black rockfish are accounted for in the Washington regional assessment (Table 1).

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) provided commercial fishery landings based on fish ticket records of black rockfish harvested off Oregon by vessels landing at ports in Washington.  Landings were less than 1 mt per year for the period of 1971 to 2014; therefore, all landings to Washington ports were assumed to occur in waters off Washington in this assessment.


#### Foreign Fishery Removals of `r spp`

Rogers [-@rogers_species_2003] developed catch reconstructions for removals by foreign trawlers operating off the U.S. West Coast during the late 1960s to mid-1970s. Although this study reports that Japanese vessels operating in the Columbia and Eureka statistical areas (Oregon and northern California) caught substantial amounts of `r spp`, with cumulative catches of more than 500 mt over 10 years, it seems very unlikely that foreign vessels could have operated sufficiently close to shore to catch appreciable amounts of `r spp`. This assessment does not include Rogers' [-@rogers_species_2003] estimates of foreign fleet removals of `r spp`. 


### Recreational Removals

The Washington recreational catch history of `r spp` was reconstructed using several direct and indirect records of `r spp` catch (Table \ref{tab:allcatches}). All primary sources report catch in numbers of fish. As sources have been modified and re-evaluated, a completely new catch reconstruction for Washington was developed for 2015 assessment. This catch history was updated to include 2015-2022 estimates in this assessment. 

Comparisons of total fishery removals in the current and previous assessments are in Figure .

### Estimated Discards

In the previous assessment, commercial discards were not accounted for due to the information provided by the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) at that time, showing about a 1% discard rate in their survey.  We evaluated the WCGOP estimates of black rockfish discards from 2002-2013, which showed a total of 32.2 mt in estimated discards and total landings of 2042.5 mt coastwide, resulting in a rough discard rate estimate of 1.58%.  

Recreational discard estimates were not available until 2002.  Numbers of discarded-by-depth black rockfish were estimated using the same catch expansion algorithm for landed catch.  Surface release mortalities adopted by the Groundfish Management Team (GMT) in their death-by-depth matrix (11%, 20%, 29%, and 63%) were then applied to the number of released black rockfish for each of 4 release depth bins (0-10 fm, 11-20 fm, 21-30 fm, and >30fm), respectively. Total dead released black rockfish were then summed across each depth bin. The average weights of discards were assumed to be the same as the average weights of landed and multiplied by the number of released dead to get total dead in metric tons.   For pre-2002 release, proportions of releases based on a ratio estimator using 2003-2007 data were applied.  For the split between charter and private vessels, the same algorithm used for splitting retained catch was applied. The overall average discard rate in the recreational fisheries was 1.37%. There was no information on Washington commercial discards, so the rate of 1.37% (same as the historical recreational discards) was also applied to the entire commercial time series. This low rate was similar to discard rates estimated in the other states. Annual retained and discarded catches are summarized in Table ???.

## Composition Data

Fish length measurements, primarily from the recreational fishery, are one of the major sources of data for this assessment (Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}).  


### Length and Age Sample Sizes

The level of commercial fishery sampling, trawl and non-trawl, for `r spp` has been erratic, with limited sample sizes for length and ages taken in Washington until the early 1990s. The primarily source of fishery-dependent length and age data for `r spp` arise from the recreational fishery. 


#### Multinomial Sample Sizes

Initial input values for the multinomial samples sizes determine the relative weights applied in fitting the annual composition data within the set of observations for each fishing fleet in the model.  The initial input values in this assessment were based on the following equation developed by I. Stewart and S. Miller (NWFSC), and presented at the 2006 Stock Assessment Data and Modeling workshop. The input sample sizes for all commercial data were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


### Length Compositions

The length data for the assessment model were tabulated into 2-cm length bins ranging from 10 cm to 64 cm, with accumulator bins at each end. 

The length composition data indicate some general differences between the three fishery types, with the trawl fisheries producing the largest fish, the recreational fisheries producing the smallest fish, and the non-trawl fisheries producing fish of intermediate length (Figures \ref{fig:trawl-length-comps}-\ref{fig:rec-length-comps}).  There is little evidence in any of the length composition data of distinct modes or successions of modes from one year to the next that might represent strong year-classes.


##### Commercial

The biological data for the commercial fishery were extracted from PacFIN on 23 March, 2023. These data are from trawl and non-trawl (hook-and-line) fisheries; there is no live-fish fishery off Washington. Of the 9,009 records available within PacFIN (each representing a single specimen), 4,989 were from the commercial trawl fishery (Table X).

Length composition data are reported either in fork length or total length. Fork lengths are preferred; where they are missing the total length is used. These data are expanded to reduce the effect of non-uniform sampling effort (Table X). The expansions are by weight, catch/sampled catch; first on a per-trip level, and then on a per-year, per-fishery level.  Expansion factors have a minimum value of 1, and are capped at their 90th percentile value. The final sample size is the product of the two expansion factors, which is then capped at its 90th percentile value.  The final sample sizes for the Washington biological data ranged from 1 to 389.7, with a median value of 10.4.  

The data were stratified by gender and fishery.  The final sample sizes were stratified and summed by length bin (10 cm to 64 cm bins, 2 cm in width), and an effective sample size is computed from the number of trips and number of fish each stratum represents, according to the Stewart and Miller method for multinomial fishery data. Unsexed fish were treated as above, but entered as a separate dataset.


##### Recreational

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife biological database provided sampled length data from the recreational fishery for sexed and unsexed samples for years 1979-2022. Sexed samples were the largest sample sizes and covered most years (Table XX). Composition data were used as collected (i.e., not expanded). Effective sample sizes were based on unique "sequence" sizes, which is roughly equivalent to a trip. 

#### Survey data

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife provided sampled length data from the tagging survey for sexed and unsexed samples for years 1981-2022 (Table XX). Unsexed and sexed data were generally available in different years. Like the recreational data, composition data were used as collected (i.e., not expanded) and effective sample sizes were based on unique "sequence" sizes, which is roughly equivalent to a trip. 

#### Age Compositions

Commercial age composition data were a subset of the length data, 7984 records in total, and were expanded in the same manner as the lengths (Table XX).  Ages were stratified by fishery and sex, and binned in 1-year bins from 0 to 40.  As for the length compositions, the unsexed fish (29 samples) were treated as a separate dataset.  Samples were also available by sex for several years in the recreational data (Table 56).  Age samples are available by sex from 1980 until 2022 in the recreational data.  Ages are binned in 1 year bins from 0 to 40 stratified by sex (Table XX).

Conditional age-at-length compositions were not expanded, though marginal compositions were. For conditional age-at-length data the effective sample sizes were the sum of all individual age samples per length bin. Ages were modeled as conditional age-at-length, though marginal age compositions were included in the model with no contribution to the likelihood. This inclusion allows one to see how well the marginal age compositions are fit without having them effect overall model fit.

### Abundance Indices

Indices of abundance can provide another source to inform the trend and dynamics of the population.  Most assessments of U.S. West Coast groundfish stocks rely on estimates of relative stock biomass from research trawl surveys to provide information on biomass trends, but `r spp` are very infrequently caught in any of the bottom trawl surveys, which have a limited coverage of shallow nearshore waters (none of the surveys have ever been conducted in waters shallower than 55 m). Thus fishery-dependent catch-per-unit effort data are often considered as a source for tracking abundance. Below is a description of how recreational data was considered as an index for `r spp`. 

#### Dockside Catch-Per-Unit-Effort for Washington

The WDFW provided recreational dockside fisheries data from 1981 through 2022 for consideration in this assessment. Data were collected at the trip level, with the number of landed fish and the number of anglers on each vessel being recorded. The amount of time fished by each angler was not recorded. This data had also been provided for the 2015 `r spp` Assessment where authors used the Stephens-MacCall method [@stephens_multispecies_2004] as an objective approach for identifying trip records of catch/effort data, and several covariates including year, month, boat type, area, daily bag limits and depth restrictions. For the 2015 Assessment data were modeled using a delta-GLM approach, where the catch occurrence (binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the positive catch component was modeled using either lognormal or gamma distributions. 

The recreational dockside data was considered for use in this assessment, however, management measures implemented over the past several decades impeded extracting a reliable signal for use as abundance indices. In 2003, management restricted summer fishing depths to shallower than 20-fathoms in WDFW marine areas 3 and 4, and in 2006 modified this depth restriction to 30-fathoms in marine areas 2, 3, and 4. Additionally, daily rockfish limits were 15 fish from 1981-1991, 12 fish from 1992-1994 (except in area 1 where it remained at 15), 10 fish from 1995-2016, and a reduction to 7 fish from 2017-2022. The effects of these management changes to CPUE of `r spp` could not be reconciled with changes in the abundance indices and therefore this dataset was not used in this assessment.
