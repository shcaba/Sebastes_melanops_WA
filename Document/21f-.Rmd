## Fishery-Dependent Data

The following subsections describe the removal histories for each fleet. Some assumptions about historical removals were revisited and changed from the last assessment. Comparisons of total fishery removals in the current and previous assessments are shown in (Figure \ref{fig:catch-ts-comparison}).

### Commercial Removals

#### Landings {#com-landings}

The systems along the U.S. West Coast for monitoring commercial fishery landings in the past did not keep track of the landings of individual rockfish species, largely because many rockfish species have similar market characteristics and therefore were landed as an unsorted mix of species. `r Spp` in particular, which are a nearshore species and much less abundant than many of the offshore rockfish species, were generally landed in mixed-species categories and were not required to be sorted into its own market category until 2006.  As a consequence, the historical records do not provide a detailed accounting of the landings of `r spp`.  The basic approach taken to develop the landings series in this assessment (as in past assessments) was to apply values for the proportion of `r spp` sampled in mixed-rockfish landings.  Data on the proportions of `r spp` are sparse, with the consequence that the landings reconstructions are highly uncertain.

Since 1935, commercial fishing vessels have been required to submit a fish receiving ticket ("fish ticket") for each landing. Rockfish landings from domestic fishers are usually reported in mixed-species market categories, but were not routinely sampled for species composition by port samplers until 2000.  The information required on the fish ticket and sampling methods have changed through time. A historical catch reconstruction for `r spp` was conducted for the 2015 stock assessment of `r spp` [@cope_assessments_2016]. We keep the same catch history and updated the total removal time series through 2022 (Table \ref{tab:total_removals}).  

It has been and continues to be a common practice for Oregon fleets to fish off the Washington coast and land their catches in Oregon ports. Although the separate geographic assessments by state region would ideally have strict geographic separation of landed catch to the location of capture, this is not possible to accomplish because information on the fishing location is generally unavailable.    Beginning in 2004, Oregon required a logbook for commercial vessels participating in its nearshore fishery.  To account for the `r spp` removed from Washington water by Oregon fleets historically, staff from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) used species composition samples collected during 1976 to 1993 to conduct an analysis of the spatial distribution of `r spp` landed at Astoria, OR.  Astoria is the northernmost port in Oregon and is located near the mouth of the Columbia River, which forms the boundary between Oregon and Washington. The portion of aggregated rockfish landed pounds that were taken north of the Columbia River (i.e., from waters off Washington) was 98.6%.  This percentage was applied to all historical trawl landings of rockfish at Oregon's Columbia River District ports prior to 1976. Of the 98.6% of aggregated rockfish landings, it was assumed 14.1% was `r spp` in the 2015 assessment [@cope_assessments_2016]. This percentage is much higher than the values used for the Washington catch reconstruction. Therefore, we recalculated this portion by using Washington’s historical species composition data which is not available in Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) for pre-1981 and data available in PacFIN for 1981 to 1986. The revised proportions of `r spp` in the aggregated rockfish trawl landings are 3% and 4% for pre-1981 and 1981-1986, respectively.  Non-trawl landings into Astoria were assumed to have been caught from Oregon waters, which is the same assumption used in the 2015 assessment.  

Starting in 1994 `r spp` landed into Oregon were legally required to be sorted and sold in a separate `r spp` market category and were also reported as separate retained catches in the mandatory trawl logbooks.  Based on the retained catches reported in the logbooks, the estimated proportion of the trawl-caught `r spp` that were caught from off Washington and landed into Astoria ranged from 65 to 100%. These `r spp` are accounted for in the Washington regional assessment (Table \ref{tab:rec_catch_reconstruction}).

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) provided commercial fishery landings based on fish ticket records of `r spp` harvested off Oregon by vessels landing at ports in Washington.  Landings were less than 1 mt per year for the period of 1971 to 2014; therefore, all landings to Washington ports were assumed to occur in waters off Washington in this assessment.


#### Foreign Fishery Removals of `r spp`

Rogers [-@rogers_species_2003] developed catch reconstructions for removals by foreign trawlers operating off the U.S. West Coast during the late 1960s to mid-1970s. Although this study reports that Japanese vessels operating in the Columbia and Eureka statistical areas (Oregon and northern California) caught substantial amounts of `r spp`, with cumulative catches of more than 500 mt over 10 years, it seems very unlikely that foreign vessels could have operated sufficiently close to shore to catch appreciable amounts of `r spp`. This assessment does not include Rogers' [-@rogers_species_2003] estimates of foreign fleet removals of `r spp`. 


### Recreational Removals

The Washington recreational catch history of `r spp` was reconstructed using several direct and indirect records of `r spp` catch (Table \ref{tab:rec_catch_reconstruction}). All primary sources report catch in numbers of fish. As sources have been modified and re-evaluated, a completely new catch reconstruction for Washington was developed for 2015 assessment. This catch history was updated to include 2015-2022 estimates in this assessment. 



### Estimated Discards

In the previous assessment, commercial discards were not accounted for due to the information provided by the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) at that time, showing about a 1% discard rate in their survey.  We evaluated the WCGOP estimates of `r spp` discards from 2002-2013, which showed a total of 32.2 mt in estimated discards and total landings of 2,042.5 mt coastwide, resulting in a rough discard rate estimate of 1.58%.  

Recreational discard estimates were not available until 2002.  Numbers of discarded-by-depth `r spp` were estimated using the same catch expansion algorithm for landed catch.  Surface release mortalities used in the previous assessment [@cope_assessments_2016] were applied to the number of released `r spp` in the current assessment for each of the release depth bins (0-10 fm, 11-20 fm, 21-30 fm, >30fm, and unknown), respectively. Total dead released `r spp` were then summed across each depth bin. The average weights of discards were assumed to be the same as the average weights of landed and multiplied by the number of released dead to get total dead in metric tons.   For pre-2002 release, proportions of releases based on a ratio estimator using 2003-2007 data were applied.   The same algorithm used for splitting retained catch was applied for the split between charter and private vessels. The overall average discard rate in the recreational fisheries was 1.37%. There was no information on Washington commercial discards, so the rate of 1.37% (same as the historical recreational discards) was also applied to the entire commercial time series. This low rate was similar to discard rates estimated in the other states. Annual retained and discarded catches are summarized in (Table \ref{tab:annual_discards}).

## Composition Data

Fish length measurements, primarily from the recreational fishery, are one of the major sources of data for this assessment (Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}).  


### Length and Age Sample Sizes

The level of commercial fishery sampling, trawl and non-trawl, for `r spp` has been erratic, with limited sample sizes for length and ages taken in Washington until the early 1990s. The primarily source of fishery-dependent length and age data for `r spp` arise from the recreational fishery. 


#### Multinomial Sample Sizes

Initial input values for the multinomial samples sizes determine the relative weights applied in fitting the annual composition data within the set of observations for each fishing fleet in the model.  The initial input values in this assessment were based on the following equation developed by I. Stewart and S. Miller (NWFSC), and presented at the 2006 Stock Assessment Data and Modeling workshop. The input sample sizes for all commercial data were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


### Length Compositions

The length data for the assessment model were tabulated into 2-cm length bins ranging from 10 cm to 64 cm, with accumulator bins at each end. 

The length composition data indicate some general differences between the three fishery types, with the trawl fisheries producing the largest fish, the recreational fisheries producing the smallest fish, and the non-trawl fisheries producing fish of intermediate length (Figures \ref{fig:trawl-length-comps}-\ref{fig:rec-length-comps}), though the difference between the last two are not large.  There is little evidence in any of the length composition data of distinct modes or successions of modes from one year to the next that might represent strong year-classes.


##### Commercial

Biological data for the commercial fishery were extracted from PacFIN on 23 March, 2023. These data are from trawl and non-trawl (hook-and-line) fisheries (there has been no live-fish fishery off Washington). Of the 8,807 records available within PacFIN (each representing a single specimen), 4,990 were from the commercial trawl fishery (Table \ref{tab:WA_Comm_Lt_samps}).

For use as compositional data in the assessment, lengths undergo a two-stage expansion as implemented in the [PacFIN.Utilities R library](https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/PacFIN.Utilities). The expansions are by weight, catch/sampled catch; first on a per-trip level, and then on a per-year, per-fishery level.  Expansion factors have a minimum value of 1, and are capped at their 90th percentile value. The final sample size is the product of the two expansion factors, which is then capped at its 90th percentile value.

The data were stratified by fishery and sex (Table \ref{tab:WA_Comm_Lt_samps}).  The final sample sizes were stratified and summed by length bin (10 cm to 64 cm bins, 2 cm in width), and an effective sample size is computed from the number of trips and number of fish each stratum represents, according to the Stewart and Miller method for multinomial fishery data.


##### Recreational

The WDFW biological database provided sampled length data from the recreational fishery for sexed and unsexed samples for years 1979-2022. Sexed samples were the largest sample sizes and covered most years (Table \ref{tab:rec_length_sample}). Composition data were used as collected (i.e., not expanded). Effective sample sizes were based on unique "sequence" sizes, which is roughly equivalent to a trip. 

#### Survey data

The WDFW provided sampled length data from the tagging survey for sexed and unsexed samples for years 1981-2022. Samples from 1998-2018 were used in the analysis for the indices (Table \ref{tab:survey_sample_indices}). Unsexed and sexed data were generally available in different years. Like the recreational data, composition data were used as collected (i.e., not expanded) and effective sample sizes were based on unique "sequence" sizes, which is roughly equivalent to a trip. 

#### Age Compositions

Commercial age composition data were a subset of the length data, 7,863 records in total, and were expanded in the same manner as the lengths (Table \ref{tab:WA_Comm_Lt_samps}).  Ages were stratified by fishery and sex (female, male and unsexed), and binned in 1-year bins from 0 to 40. 

Samples were also available by sex for several years in the recreational data (Table \ref{tab:rec_age_sample}).  Age samples are available by sex from 1980 until 2022 in the recreational data, and comprise the largest amount of age data in the model.  Ages are binned in 1 year bins from 0 to 40 stratified by sex.

Conditional age-at-length compositions were not expanded, though marginal compositions were. For conditional age-at-length data the effective sample sizes were the sum of all individual age samples per length bin. Ages were modeled as conditional age-at-length, though marginal age compositions were included in the model with no contribution to the likelihood. This inclusion allows one to see how well the marginal age compositions are fit without having them effect overall model fit.

### Abundance Indices

Indices of abundance can provide another source to inform the trend and dynamics of the population.  Most assessments of U.S. West Coast groundfish stocks rely on estimates of relative stock biomass from research trawl surveys to provide information on biomass trends, but `r spp` are very infrequently caught in any of the bottom trawl surveys, which have a limited coverage of shallow nearshore waters (none of the surveys have ever been conducted in waters shallower than 55 m). Thus fishery-dependent catch-per-unit effort data are often considered as a source for tracking abundance. Below is a description of how recreational data was considered as an index for `r spp`. 

#### Dockside Catch-Per-Unit-Effort for Washington

WDFW’s Ocean Sampling Program (OSP) collects data on catch and effort in the State’s coastal recreational fisheries. This dockside data was considered for use as a fishery-dependent index of abundance for 1981-2022. OSP collects trip level data with key data fields including the number of landed fish by species or species category, the number of anglers, marine area fished, and trip and boat type. The number of released fish has only been recorded since 2003. Finer scale measures of effort, such as the amount of time fished by each angler, are not recorded.

Thes data were used to produce an index of abundance for the 2015 assessment of `r spp`using the available years at the time. The analysts used the Stephens-MacCall method [@stephens_multispecies_2004] as an objective approach for identifying trips that visited `r spp` habitat. `r Spp` were found to be extremely common in bottomfish catches, so the Stephens-MacCall filtering made little difference in the data sets. The index was standardized using a delta-GLM approach, where the catch occurrence (binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the positive catch component was modeled using either lognormal or gamma distributions. 

For this assessment, the recreational dockside data in its entirety was re-evaluated to develop an index of abundance. However, changes in management measure enacted after the 2015 assessment led to further consideration of whether the data could provide a reliable signal on abundance. `r Spp` are subject to a total rockfish bag limit in Washington but make up the bulk of the retained rockfish, especially in Marine Area 2 and increasingly so over time in Marine Areas 3 and 4 (Figure \ref{fig:blackrock_percentage}). Since 2003, the rockfish limit has been a subset of a total bag limit on bottomfish. After the bag limit decreased from 10 to 7 rockfish in 2017, there was a clear drop in `r spp` CPUE limit for both private and charter boats in most every marine area (Figure \ref{fig:baglimit_numbers}). With no finer scale measure of effort available, it is not possible to determine if there were changes in the fishing or search time needed to reach the bag limit. Trips may have spent less time fishing for `r spp` than in years when the bag limit was higher.

There were several bag limit changes over the time series prior to 2017. Further evaluation of the time series showed past periods where the bag limit was also reached on a high percentage of trips, especially for charter boats in Marine Area 2 (Figure \ref{fig:baglimit_percentage}). Daily rockfish limits were 15 fish from 1981-1991, 12 fish from 1992-1994 (except in area 1 where it remained at 15), and 10 fish from 1995-2016. The fishery has seen other management measure changes where the affect on the relationship between CPUE and abundance is difficult to determine. In 2003, management restricted summer fishing depths to shallower than 20-fathoms in WDFW marine areas 3 and 4, and in 2006 modified this depth restriction to 30-fathoms in marine areas 2, 3, and 4. And sub-bag limits for desirable species like Canary Rockfish have also changed and could affect fishing behavior for `r spp`. General bottomfish bag limit changes also occurred reducing retention of total bottomfish from no limit to 15 fish in 2002 and 12 fish in 2011.  

In consideration of management changes and the potential for non-abundance related effects on CPUE, OSP dockside data was separated by fleet and filtered to create two indices, as described below. Sensitivity runs that excluded the OSP dockside data entirely were also considered.

#### Dockside CPUE Private Fleet 1981-2016

Dockside data was filtered for interviews with private boats and several covariates including year, month, area, daily bag limits and depth restrictions were considered. Depth was not consistently recorded, so depth-based management could not be filtered out. Instead, covariates for depth restrictions and daily bag limits were included to represent management changes. To be certain that the characteristics of a “trip” were comparable, the analysis was restricted to bottomfish only trips, in areas specific to rockfish, for private boats from 1981 through 2016 (43,187 records). The truncation of the data series excluded the latest large bag limit restriction that took effect in 2017.

CPUE was calculated for each angler trip, where total catch was defined as the sum of all reported retained catch (in numbers) and total effort was defined by the number of anglers. CPUE was modeled using the same delta-GLM approach used in 2015. Lognormal (Figure \ref{fig:private-log-diags}) and gamma (Figure \ref{fig:private-gam-diags}) distributions for the positive catch component were considered, but diagnostics favored the choice of a lognormal distribution for the final index. The CPUE time series is shown in Figure \ref{fig:private-index}. A bootstrap analysis (N=500) was used to estimate the coefficient of variation of the year effects (\ref{fig:private-CVs}).

#### Dockside CPUE Charter Fleet 1981-1994

For the charter boat fleet interview data collected from 1981 through 1994 was modeled as being less sensitive to the effects of bag limits. It was also a key period in the fishery where effort was ramping up. As with the private fleet analysis, data was restricted to bottomfish only trips in areas specific to rockfish, for charter boats from 1981 through 1994 (16,364 records).

Several covariates were considered in the full model including year, month, area, daily bag limit and depth restriction. As with private boats, depth was not consistently recorded and could not be used.  A covariate for daily bag limits was included to represent management changes but depth restrictions did not go into effect until after this data time series and were not incorporated. AIC was not used to choose between error distributions for the positive catches. This was instead done using quantile-quantile plots (Figures \ref{fig:charter-log-diags} and \ref{fig:charter-gam-diags}). The full model with a gamma error distribution was chosen (Figure \ref{fig:charter-index} and a bootstrap analysis (N=500) was used to estimate the the coefficient of variation of the year effects (Figure \ref{fig:charter-CVs}).
