### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast.
Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October.
This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability,
as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.
