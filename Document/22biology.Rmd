## Biological Data and Parameters

The major biological inputs to the models are natural mortality, age and growth parameters, weight-length, maturity and stock-recruitment parameters. The following sections outline the treatment of each section.

### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality is a critical parameter that drives much of the outcome of stock assessments. This value is not directly measured for black rockfish, so it either needs to be estimated or fixed in the model. Prior treatments have either used fixed ramps from lower to higher female natural mortality values (0.16 to 0.24 for females (2007 assessment); 0.17 to 0.2 (2015 assessment)) to constant male natural mortality value (0.16 in 2007; 0.17 in 2015). Females rapidly disappear from the population after 20 years of age, whereas whereas males can still be found in their 30 and 40s, with the oldest individuals along the coast aged at 56 years [@love_2011]. Females are rarely found in their 30s and males in their 40s in Oregon.

The reason for the lack of females has been debated for many years. The "hide them" (using age-based selectivity curves to hide older females) or "kill them" (using the above mentioned ramps of death to account for no older females in samples) was specifically considered since the last assessment among researchers from California to Alaska, and it was agreed that the "hide them" hypothesis is the least feasible situation (see Rasmuson et al. [-@Rasmuson_noBOFFFs_2023] for a specific study that went looking for old females). It was also agreed a constant natural mortality rate should be used for this assessment. 

Determining reasonable natural mortality values is also challenging as the quick disappearance of females form the population after 20 years old challenges typical biological assumptions, especially since black rockfishes have been the focus species when developing the theory of big old fat fecund female contributions to spawning output [@bobko_maturity_2004; @hixon_boffffs_2014]. In a study confirming the advanced capacity for output of older females [@berkeley_maternal_2008] the oldest aged females in the study were under 20 years, so the enhanced reproductive capacity, despite the loss of females after 20 years of age, is still intact. 

Using the Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_Mprior_2022] longevity-based estimator of natural mortality as implemented in the natural mortality tool [-@cope_NMT_2022], the following M values correspond to the longevity estimates:

- 0.108 at 50 years
- 0.135 at 40 years
- 0.180 at 30 years
- 0.216 at 25 years
- 0.270 at 20 years

These provide reasonable bookends for likely natural mortality values for black rockfish. For females, estimates based on the von Bertalanffy growth function range from 0.27-0.32 and for males, 0.34 to 0.38. Those estimates are on the very high side, and thus are not considered further. 

Exploratory runs first attempted to estimate natural mortality with not unrealistic, but slightly low, estimates. The base model instead fixes natural mortality to the values from the last assessment (`r round(model$MGparmAdj$NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1[1], 3)` for females and `r round(model$MGparmAdj$NatM_uniform_Mal_GP_1[1], 3)` for males), while providing a sensitivity to the estimated M values. A likelihood profile across the above mentioned range of natural mortality values, but maintaining the above ratio of female to male natural mortality, is also included to explore model sensitivity, as this parameter may be a useful parameter to establish different states of nature for uncertainty analysis. 


#### Age and growth relationship

The length-at-age was estimated for female and male `r spp` using data from collections sampling the commercial and recreational fisheries off the coast of Washington (Figure \ref{tab:len-age-data-sex} and Figure \ref{tab:len-age-sex-year}), with all lengths in fork length and all ages in years. Figure \ref{fig:len-age-fit} shows the predicted von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 51.19 cm; $k$ = 0.15; $t_0$ = -2.50

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 47.26 cm; $k$ = 0.17; $t_0$ = -2.99

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The coefficient of variation of length by age fluctuated around 0.07 to 0.1 for the most well sampled ages and was similar for each sex (Figure \ref{tab:cv-lt-age}). When estimated in the models, these same values would often be produced, but it was ultimately determined it is more parsimonious to fix to 0.1 for both sexes. The value for $t_0$ is also fixed in the base model, as estimation of that parameter lead to  extremely high current biomass values.

The estimated VBGF parameters provided initial values for the estimation of growth in the model, as all age and length data are included in the model and parameters $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ are estimated. The resultant growth curves estimated by the model are presented in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}. Sensitivity to fixing the growth parameters to the external values, fixing $t_0$ to 0, and estimating $t_0$ are explored through sensitivity analyses.


### Ageing Bias and Precision

Counting ages from ageing structures in long-lived, temparate fishes is challenging. Ages derived from these structures can be hard to reproduce within and between readers (i.e., imprecision), and may not contain the true age (i.e., bias). Stock assessment outputs can be affected by bias and imprecision in ageing, thus it is important to quantify and integrate this source of variability when fitting age data in assessments. In Stock Synthesis, this is done by including ageing error matrices that include the mean age (row 1) and standard deviation in age (row 2). Ageing bias is implemented when the inputted mean age deviates from the expected middle age for any given age bin (e.g., 1.75 inputted versus 1.5 being the true age); ageing imprecision is given as the standard deviation for each age bin (row 2).

Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife has two main readers to assign to the available ages. Reader 1 read samples from the earliest period through 2018 and Reader 2 read samples from 2019 to 2022. Age bias plots show little bias within and between the readers (Figure \ref{fig:Age1_1plots}). 

Estimation of ageing error matrices used the approach of Punt et al. [-@punt_quantifying_2008] and release 1.1.0 of the R package \href{https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscAgeingError}{nwfscAgeingError} [@thorson_nwfscageingerror:_2012]. The ageing error matrix offers a way to calculate both bias and imprecision in age reads. Reader 1, the primary reader of the ages used in the stock assessment, is always considered unbiased, but may be imprecise. Several model configurations are available for exploration based on either the functional form (e.g., constant CV, curvilinear standard deviation, or curvilinear CV) of the bias in the second read or reader or in the precision of the readers. Model selection uses AIC corrected for small sample size (AICc), which converges to AIC when sample sizes are large. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was also considered when selecting a final model. Table \ref{tab:ageing_error_mods} provides model selection results.

The calculated bias relationships from the best fit model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:age-error-bias} and confirm small to little bias between readers. Figure \ref{fig:age-error-sd} shows the imprecision estimates of the best fit models. Each ageing error matrix was then applied to the appropriate time and fleet combination.


### Length-Weight Relationship

The length(cm)-weight(kg) relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using biological data available from the Oregon commercial and recreational fisheries (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-data}). The resultant relationship is very similar for both males and females, and is very close also to what is seen in the state of Washington (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-or-wa}). The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was $W$=`r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at $W$=`r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^.


### Maturation and Fecundity



The `r spp` fecundity-at-length  relationship was provided by E.J. Dick (SWFSC) and based on the work from Dick [-@dick_modeling_2009]. The fecundity relationship was estimated equal to $Fec$=`r format(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.


### Stock-recruitment function and compensation

The Beverton-Holt stock-recruit model [@beverton_holt_1957] has been the traditional recruitment function for rockfishes and is assumed for black rockfish.  Specifically, the re-parameterized Beverton-Holt that uses a steepness parameter defined as the proportion of average recruitment for an unfished population expected for a population at 20% of unfished spawning output (Mace and Doonan) was used in these assessments.  This is a notoriously difficult parameter to estimate, thus several attempts to derive a prior of steepness have been attempted [@myers_etal_1995; @dorn_advice_2002]. The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, and is the primary source of information on steepness for west coast rockfishes. The prior ($h$; beta distribution with $\mu$=`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` and $\sigma$=0.15) is used in this assessment, but attempts to estimate steepness were not successful, so it is fixed and its influence is explored via a likelihood profile.


### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50.
