## Biological Data

The major biological inputs to the models are age and growth parameters, natural mortality, weight-length, maturity and stock-recruitment parameters (Table 40 (OR), and Table 63 (WA)).


### Natural Mortality

Previous assessments of black rockfish used different rates of natural mortality for males versus females to account for the lack of older females in fishery samples (Figure 5 and Figure 6).  The assumed instantaneous rate of natural mortality (M) for males was 0.16 and was constant with age.  Females assumed the male natural mortality value up to age 10, after which natural mortality linearly increased to 0.24 (up to age 15), remaining constant for all subsequent ages. The lower of the two natural mortality rates corresponds to a longevity of only 27 years. Given that individuals over the age of 30 are not uncommon in the age samples being used in the assessment (Figure 3), this seems to be an overestimate of what M should be for black rockfish (Figure 5). Furthermore, the major increase in female natural mortality is invoked well before the theoretical age of asymptotic length, a theory which seems very unlikely given what is known about rockfish life history and growth. This decline in female sex ratio is also seen in other rockfishes (e.g., canary and yellowtail rockfish). The most recent canary rockfish assessment also invoked a similar ramp up to natural mortality to explain this discrepancy on the data (Figure 5).

The pre-STAR approach in this assessment was to fix values of natural mortality at ages to be more in line with the proposed longevity of black rockfish (56 years old; [@love_2011]) and coupled with an age-based selectivity for females to account for the missing samples of that sex (see Section 2.3for details).  A variety of natural mortality estimates based on longevity values and von Bertalanffy values were explored (Table 3).  The estimators using the von Bertalanffy values were ultimately chosen because they incorporated both sex and area differences in natural mortality. This choice of dome-shaped age-based selectivity and fixed lower natural mortality causes the productivity of the population to drop greatly relative to assuming a logistic selectivity and a ramp in M, but also creates a very large amount of cryptic (i.e. unavailable) biomass (Figure 7) compared to the model with a ramp in M (Figure 8). Given such high relative cryptic biomass when invoking dome-shaped age-based selectivity, but discomfort with the M ramp scenario, it was decided during the STAR panel that estimating a sex-specific M was a defensible approach in lieu of data supporting either dome-shaped selectivity and high cryptic biomass or extreme natural mortality values using a ramp in M, and thus was adopted as the approach to M in the California and Washington base models. Sensitivities to the other proposed treatments of natural mortality were also provided.


### Growth (Length-at-Age)

Age and length data were available for all states across years, so an initial investigation of the growth parameters across areas was produced to look at spatial and temporal trends by sex. The standard von Bertalanffy growth function was used to fit the length and age data. Washington State had the most years of available composition data (Figure 2). In general, males seem to be consistently better sampled in all states (Figure 3). Patterns of growth between sexes are similar among areas, while trends in parameters estimates are apparent in California and Washington (Figure 25 and Figure 193).  Washington was the best temporally and numerically sampled area, with California having the fewest samples. Given the level of data, attempts were made to estimate growth parameters internal to the model. When that was not possible, the parameters were fixed to the external fits (Table 18 (CA); Table 40 (OR); Table 63 (WA)).


### Ageing Precision and Bias

Ageing otoliths, while a common practice, rarely provides a prefect estimate of true age. This ageing error (both in bias and imprecision) can have large effects on stock assessment outputs and should be incorporated when using ages. Several multiple age read studies were available to develop ageing error vectors for use in interpreting conditional ages at length. For Washington, there were two data sets: 1) 280 triple reads from WDFW for the commercial fisheries and 2) 3240 double reads from WDFW for the recreational fishery. For Oregon, the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) provided a set of 302 multiple reads (five total readers), while ODFW provided 150 from five readers. California had one set of 318 double reads from the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP).). Resultant forms for each chosen model are given in Figure 4.

The Punt et al. [-@punt_quantifying_2008] method and accompanying software was used to determine the underlying true age distribution and resultant imprecision, assuming at least one of the readers is unbiased. The first reader in all comparisons was assumed unbiased, but we considered several model configurations based on the functional form (unbiased, linear or curvilinear) of bias in the subsequent readers, and precisions of all readers (constant CV, curvilinear standard deviation, or curvilinear CV). Model selection was based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) corrected for small sample size (AICc), which converges to AIC when sample sizes are large. Both Washington data sets supported a linear bias in the other readers and constant CV of precision for all readers (Table 2). Oregon data sets agreed that linear bias and curvilinear precision was best supported (Table 2). The California data set supports curvilinear bias in the second reader with constant CV for both readers (Table 2). Resultant forms for each chosen model are given in Figure 4.


### Length-Weight Relationship

Length-weight relationships (kg to fork lengths) were developed with state-specific data. The California weight-length relationship was based on 8943 combined sex samples (Table 18). Oregon relationships were based on length and weight measurements from almost 4,000 individual black rockfish of combined sex and was the same as used in the previous assessment (Table 40). Washington relationships were sex-specific and based on 1551 female samples and 1284 males samples (Table 63), though both sexes had very similar relationships.


### Maturation and Fecundity

The black rockfish maturity is assumed to be based on length, as assumed in past assessments. A notable difference in our approach in these assessments is the use of functional maturity instead of sexual maturity (the typical application). Functional maturity is a more stringent definition of maturity as compared to sexual maturity. Instead of just using the presence of yolk as a measure of sexual maturity, functional maturity takes into account both the presence of strict spawning individuals and the level of atresia or skipped spawning. Such an approach yields length at 50% maturity estimates larger than the standard sexual maturity application. Melissa Head of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center provided estimates of both functional and sexual maturity from black rockfish sampled in the months of July to January (deemed the best time for identifying mature individuals) off Oregon and Washington waters combined. The logistic fit to those the functional and sexual maturity values are found in Table 4. The functional maturity values were sampled from individuals from one year, which happened to be the year of the "warm blob". It is therefore unknown how this may have affected the estimate of functional maturity, particularly the levels of mass atresia in older individuals. Discussion in the STAR panel lead to the decision to assume all individuals above 45cm to be mature in the functional maturity data set in order to be conservative on the estimate of the effect of atresia on maturity estimation. The functional maturity values from this modified data set are used for all states, but sensitivities to the new sexual maturity estimate, as well as the respective area values from the previous assessments and the unmodified functional maturity data set are explored.

Similarly, this assessment, like previous assessments, assumes that weight-specific fecundity is linearly related to female body weight. Values for the slope and intercept were taken from Dick [-@dick_modeling_2009] and are found in the parameterization tables for each state assessment model (Table 18 (CA); Table 40 (OR); Table 63 (WA)). 


### Stock-recruitment function and compensation

The Beverton-Holt stock-recruit model [@beverton_holt_1957] has been the traditional recruitment function for rockfishes and is assumed for black rockfish.  Specifically, the re-parameterized Beverton-Holt that uses a steepness parameter defined as the proportion of average recruitment for an unfished population expected for a population at 20% of unfished spawning output (Mace and Doonan) was used in these assessments.  This is a notoriously difficult parameter to estimate, thus several attempts to derive a prior of steepness have been attempted [@myers_etal_1995; @dorn_advice_2002].  This prior is typically updated each cycle (following the method of Dorn 2002) and subject to a review by the Council's Science and Statistical Committee.  The prior for 2015 has an expected value of 0.773 and a standard deviation of 0.147 using a beta distribution. Attempts were made to estimate this value, but were not successful, so it is fixed and its influence is explored via a likelihood profile.


### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50.
