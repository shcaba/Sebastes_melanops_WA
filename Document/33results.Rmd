## Reference Model Diagnostics and Results


### Model Convergence and Acceptability {#model-convergence}

While there is no definitive measure of model convergence, several measures are routinely applied. These criteria include a low maximum gradient (`r model$maximum_gradient_component`), inversion of the Hessian (passed), acceptable fits to data (passed), and reasonable parameter values (passed). 

Model efficiency was explored by doing a short run Bayesian analysis using the Random Walk Metropolis with 2,000 draws, keeping all the draws and examining the fast mixing parameters. Those estimated parameters that do not move much from the initial values slow the model down and are recommended to be fixed at the starting value [@monnahan_overcoming_2019]. This resulted in the fixing of five selectivity parameters (Figure \ref{fig:pairs_plot_fast}).

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.001. This was repeated 100 times with 7 out of 100 runs returned to the reference model likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:jitter}). There were another 26 models within 1 -log likelihood unit from the reference model, and another 44 within 2 -log likleihood units, all returning very similar model results. Out of the 100 jitter runs, a better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of the remaining runs. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. 


## Base Model Results

#### Fits to the Data

##### Lengths

Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Fits to the annual length composition are shown in [Appendix A](#app_a). 

Pearson residuals of fits to the fishery and survey length data are reasonably small with no distinct patterns (Figure \ref{fig:lt-pearson-resids}). 

Model fits to the mean lengths, assuming Francis data-weighting, do not closely follow the dynamics in means lengths in the relatively small trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:trawl-mean-len-fit}). The mean lengths generally follow the trend seen in the non-trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-len-fit}) and recreational (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}) fisheries, but still miss the detailed dynamics. The tagging survey fits are one of the better in the model (Figure \ref{fig:tag-mean-len-fit}). Fits to the mean length in the Nearshore survey, only three points at this point, are not particularly good (Figure \ref{fig:nearshore-mean-len-fit}). The fits to the mean length data from the dive survey does follow the general trend in the data (Figure \ref{fig:ocnms-mean-len-fit}). All length weighting are near the value of 1 as is expected when using the Francis weighting method. One thing to note is the general weak contrast in the data over the past two decades.

Aggregate fits over year by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The aggregates are fairly good, though there does seem to be a slight underfitting of the bigger individuals seen in the fishery-based samples.   

##### Conditional Age at Length

Fits to the mostly sex-specific conditional age at length data are examined based on the age-at-length Pearson residuals, the annual mean ages, and mean age at length by year for the trawl, non-trawl and ocean boat fishery samples. The maximum size of the Pearson residuals for each fleets was fairly small (maximum = 8.71, 18.54, and 25.87 for the trawl, non-trawl and recreational samples, respectively; [Appendix B](#app_b)). The biggest residual was an extreme outlier, as most of the residuals were small and not noteworthy and demonstrate the expected shape of the growth curve. There is more contrast in the age data versus the length data, as the mean age by year followed the population dynamics in the model (Figures \ref{fig:trawl-mean-caal}, \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-caal}, and \ref{fig:rec-mean-caal}). The mean age for the trawl fishery was consistently around 10 years, whereas the mean ages for the non-trawl fishery started higher (13 years) and declined to around 8 years. The recreational fishery, the longest time series, started around 13, dropped to the lowest value of close to 8, levels off between 9 and 10 years, then increases to just under 12 years in 2022. Fits to the mean ages by length bins show acceptable fits consistent with model expectations [Appendix C](#app_c).

##### Marginal Age compositions

Marginal age compositions are not fit in the model, but they are included in order to see how well they fit the reference model without influencing the likelihood [Appendix D](#app_d). Marginal length and age composition cannot be used in the same model ginve the overlap of the same fish in both samples. This is why ages conditioned on lengths are often used with the length compositions. But it still stands that age compositions, instead of lengths, could be used. So adding the marginal age compositions passively (i.e., not contributing to the overall likelihood of the model) can offer insight into how consistent they are with the current model fit. Overall the fits are very good, and in an exploratory model run the length compositions were replaced with the age compositions and a very similar model result was obtained. Thus the conditional age at length compositions coupled with either length or age compositions provide similar results. This is likely due to the fact that the conditional ages capture the underlying age structure sufficiently to following the age structure over time.   

##### Fits to Indices of Abundance

The fits to the six available indices of abundance are generally weak (Figures \ref{fig:charter-index-fit} to \ref{fig:ocnms-yoy-index-fit}). The best fit index is found for the one with the longest time series, the private boat recreational fishery index (Figure \ref{fig:private-index-fit}). It demonstrates an initial poor fit in the period of large catches, but then captures a generally increasing trend. In contrast is the fit to the charter fishery that covers the same years and shows a very similar selectivity, but shows an opposing downward trend (Figure \ref{fig:charter-index-fit}). The tagging (Figure \ref{fig:tag-index-fit}) and nearshore (Figure \ref{fig:nearshore-index-fit}) fisheries also overlap in the population being sampled by the recreational fishery indices, and both show general trends captured, but poor overall fits.

The two fishery independent surveys, the OCNMS dive (Figure \ref{fig:ocnms-index-fit}) and the tagging survey (Figure \ref{fig:tag-index-fit}) and the young of the year (YOY) survey (Figure \ref{fig:ocnms-yoy-index-fit}) show mixed results in regard to fit. While the dive survey is not particularly well fit, the YOY survey does show some concurrence with the reference model. 

### Reference Model Outputs 

#### Parameter Estimates

A total of five population parameters, four survey variances and eightteen selectivity parameters were estimated, along with sixty-two recruitment deviations. The reference model parameter estimates along with asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model-params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived outputs and reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are provided in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. 

The estimates of sex-specific growth parameters showed some differences from the externally estimated starting values (Table \ref{tab:model-params} and Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}). The estimated $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ for females and males were slightly greater and lower than the values estimated externally, respectively.  The majority of female and male `r spp` growth occurs at younger ages, reaching near maximum length by age 20-25, depending upon sex, with female `r spp` reaching larger maximum lengths (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}).

The time series of estimated recruitment deviations and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Years with major recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred  around 1999, 2007, and 2010. These years are very similar to recruitment deviations seen in other rockfishes. One curious signal is the string of positive deviations from 2005-2013, though this is consistently apparent in most model runs. The variance check on the recruitment deviations indicates well informed recruitments from the early 1960s to 2017, providing justification for the estimation of recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:varcheck}). Recruitment deviations after 2017 are relatively uninformed and are not estimated, as is not unexpected from the lag in selectivity with the biological compositions. The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}. The Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship compared to the recruitment deviations are given in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}.

Estimated selectivity curves for each fleet and survey (Figure \ref{fig:fleet_selectivity}) are all logistic (even though dome-shaped parameters were estimated) and look plausible given the biology (i.e., as a model convergence check for realism, the selectivity curves must look plausible). The commercial fisheies are more right shifted than the other the recreational fishery. The estimate of the peak size of selectivity for the fisheries biggest removal sources (trawl: = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Trawl_wdis(1)", 3],2)` cm; non-trawl = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Non-Trawl_wdis(2)", 3],2)` cm; recreational ocean boat = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Ocean(3)", 3],2)` cm) are above the size of 50% functional maturity (40 cm). 

#### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is provided in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. Estimated spawning output shows a decline from the start of the time series, but a distinct drop in biomass starting in the early 1980s when the recreational fishery begins in earnest and there is a peak in the trawl fishery. This decline is consistent until the late 1990s when it then rebounds due to the cessation of the commercial fishery and several strong recruitments. The estimate of total biomass over time, which tracks that of spawning output, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}. 

Relative spawning output declined below the management target ($SB_{40\%}$) in the 1980s when all three fisheries were active, but rebounded to above the target in the the last couple of years (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The relative stock status at the start of `r endyr + 1` (`r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Bratio_2021','Value'], 2)`) is estimated to be above the rockfish relative biomass target of 0.4. Uncertainty intervals give a range of possible current stock status solidly in the precautionary zone or well above it, but still underestimate the total uncertainly across model specifications. This emphasizes the need for alternative model specifications (mainly in the treatment of natural mortality- see likelihood profile below) to capture a broader range of uncertainty. The strong recruitment events, as well as declining catches, seem responsible for the dramatic increase and elevated stock status. Numbers of age-0 individuals indicate those years of particularly strong recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:recruits}). 

This current estimate shows a lower overall biomass (Figure \ref{fig:comp_ssb}), but similar relative stock status, as the 2015 stock assessment (Figure \ref{fig:comp_depl}). This lower biomass is largely due to the change in the catch history, removing 100 of metric tons of historical trawl catch, thus causing the assessment biomass to rescale downward.
