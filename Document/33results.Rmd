## Reference Model Diagnostics and Results


### Model Convergence and Acceptability

While there is no definitive measure of model convergence, several measures are routinely applied. These criteria include a low maximum gradient (`r model$maximum_gradient_component`), inversion of the Hessian (passed), acceptable fits to data (passed), and reasonable parameter values (passed). 

Model efficiency was explored by doing a short run Bayesian analysis using the Random Walk Metropolis with 2000 draws, keeping all the draws and examining the fast mixing parameters. Those estimated parameters that do not move much from the initial values slow the model down and are recommended to be fixed at the starting value [@monnahan_overcoming_2019]. This resulted in the fixing of five selectivity parameters (Figure \ref{fig:pairs_plot_fast}).

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.001. This was repeated 100 times with 2 out of 100 runs returned to the reference model likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:jitter}). A better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of the remaining runs. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. 


## Base Model Results

#### Fits to the Data

##### Lengths

Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Fits to the annual length composition are shown in [Appendix A](#app_a). 

Pearson residuals of fits to the fishery and survey length data are reasonably small with no distinct patterns (Figure \ref{fig:lt-pearson-resids}). 

Model fits to the mean lengths, assuming Francis data-weighting, do not closely follow the dynamics in means lengths in the relatively small trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:trawl-mean-len-fit}). The mean lengths generally follow the trend seen in the non-trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-len-fit}) and recreational (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}) fisheries, but still miss the detailed dynamics. The tagging survey fits are one of the better in the model (Figure \ref{fig:tag-mean-len-fit}). Fits to the mean length in the Nearshore survey, only three points at this point, are not particularly good (Figure \ref{fig:nearshore-mean-len-fit}). The fits to the mean length data from the dive survey does follow the general trend in the data (Figure \ref{fig:ocnms-mean-len-fit}). All length weighting are near the value of 1 as is expected when using the Francis weighting method. One thing to note is the general weak contrast in the data over the past two decades.

Aggregate fits over year by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The aggregates are fairly good, though there does seem to be a slight underfitting of the bigger individuals seen in the fishery-based samples.   

##### Conditional Age at Length

Fits to the mostly sex-specific conditional age at length data are examined based on the age-at-length Pearson residuals, the annual mean ages, and mean age at length by year for the trawl, non-trawl and ocean boat fishery samples. The mximum size of the Pearson residuals for each fleets was fairly small (maximum = 8.71, 18.54, and 25.87 for the trawl, non-trawl and recreational samples, respectively; [Appendix B](#app_b)). The biggest residual was an extreme outlier, as most of the residuals were small and unnoteworthy and demonstrate the expected shape of the growth curve. There is more contrast in the age data versus the length data, as the mean age by year followed the population dynamics in the model (Figures \ref{fig:trawl-mean-caal}, \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-caal}, and \ref{fig:rec-mean-caal}). The mean age for the trawl fishery was consistenly around 10 years, whereas the mean ages for the non-trawl fishery started higher (13 years) and declined to around 8 years. The recreational fishery, the longest time series, started around 13, dropped to the lowest value of close to 8, levels off between 9 and 10 years, then increases to just under 12 years in 2022. Fits to the mean ages by length bins show acceptable fits consistent with model expectations [Appendix C](#app_c).

##### Marginal Age compositions

Marginal age compositions are not fit in the model, but they are included in order to see how well they fit the reference model without influencing the likelihood [Appendix D](#app_d). Marginal length and age composition cannot be used in the same model ginve the overlap of the same fish in both samples. This is why ages conditioned on lengths are often used with the length compositions. But it still stands that age compositions, instead of lengths, could be used. So adding the marginal age compositions passively (i.e., not contributing to the overall likelihood of the model) can offer insight into how consistent they are with the current model fit. Overall the fits are very good, and in an exploratory model run the length compositions were replaced with the age compositions and a very similar model result was obtained. Thus the conditional age at length compositions coupled with either length or age compositions provide similar results. This is likely due to the fact that the conditional ages capture the underlying age structure sufficiently to following the age structure over time.   

##### Fits to Indices of Abundance

The fits to the six available indices of abundance are generally weak (Figures \ref{fig:charter-index-fit} to \ref{fig:ocnms-yoy-index-fit}). The best fit index is found for the one with the longest time series, the private boat recreational fishery index (Figure \ref{fig:private-index-fit}). It demonstrates an initial poor fit in the period of large catches, but then captures a generally increasing trend. In contrast is the fit to the charter fishery that covers the same years and shows a very similar selectivity, but shows an opposing downward trend (Figure \ref{fig:charter-index-fit}). The tagging (Figure \ref{fig:tag-index-fit}) and nearshore (Figure \ref{fig:nearshore-index-fit}) fisheries also overlap in the population being sampled by the recreational fishery indices, and both show general trends captured, but poor overall fits.

The two fishery independent surveys, the OCNMS dive (Figure \ref{fig:ocnms-index-fit}) and the tagging survey (Figure \ref{fig:tag-index-fit}) and the young of the year (YOY) survey (Figure \ref{fig:ocnms-yoy-index-fit}) show mixed results in regard to fit. While the dive survey is not particularly well fit, the YOY survey does show some concurrence with the reference model.
