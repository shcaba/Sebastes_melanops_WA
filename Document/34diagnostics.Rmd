### Sensitivity Analyses

WA:
Several sensitivity runs were considered for the Washington model. The first group of sensitivity runs (scenarios 2-4; Table 65; Supplemental table "WA Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes indices. The second group (scenarios 5-9; Table 65; Supplemental table "WA Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes length composition data. The third group (scenarios 10-13; Table 65; Supplemental table "WA Sensitivities- Like Comps") sequentially removes age composition data. The last group (scenarios 14-36: Table 66; Supplemental table "WA Sensitivities- Model specs") covers a variety of issues

1. Estimate growth deviations (1980-2014)
2. Estimate growth blocks (1980-1999; 2000-2014)
3. M ramp in females as in 2007 assessment.
4. Estimate M ramp
5. Fix M to Hamel approach value (0.0964)
6. M from STAR presented base case (based on Then et al. 2015); age-based selectivity
7. M based on Then et al. (2015) using amax = 56; age-based selectivity
8. M based on Hamel (2015) using amax = 56; age-based selectivity
9. Estimate M with dome-shaped, age-based selectivity
10. Estimate M ramp with dome-shaped, age-based selectivity
11. Sexual maturity used in the last assessment (2007)
12. M ramp in females and sexual maturity in 2007
13. Sexual maturity estimated from recent samples (2015)
14. M ramp in females and sexual maturity in 2015
15. Functional maturity using original data set
16. Fecundity is linear with intercept = 0, slope =1.
17. Fecundity from 2007 assessment
18. No recruitment estimation
19. Recruitment estimated all years; ?R tuned
20. Use harmonic mean when tuning length compositions
21. Use harmonic mean when tuning length and conditional age-at-length compositions
22. No extra variance estimated on all indices 
23. Recreational fleet length selectivity is dome-shaped 

Results of the likelihood component sensitivity runs are found in Table 65. The model was most sensitive to the exclusion of the dockside recreational index. It was also sensitive to the removal of all length and age data, and particularly to the recreational age data. 

Results of the model specification sensitivity runs are found in Table 66. The largest sensitivities were found in the treatment of maturity, selectivity and natural mortality. The use of sexual maturity (scenarios 24-27) changed the terminal year scale and status of the stock significantly, making it much less reduced in status, though having a smaller influence on catch at SPR50% (Table 21). Natural mortality scenarios with lower M but age-based selectivity had the biggest effect in spawning output (Figure 225), whereas scenarios with ramping of M caused the biggest changes in (i.e., improving) stock status (Figure 226). Fixing M to low values but not compensating with dome-shaped, age-based selectivity caused the population to crash. Scenarios with ramps in M or M estimated, regardless of selectivity form for females, caused the biggest increases in catch at SPR50%. Recruitment deviations are relatively insensitive to the different natural mortality specifications (Figure 227). Most natural mortality scenarios bring the fishing intensity below the SPR harvest level (Figure 228). 

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for the the log of initial recruitment (ln($R_0$)), steepness ($h$), and female and male natural mortality ($M$) varying together with a constant ratio matching the reference model (0.17/0.152, female and male values respectively). Likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the featured parameter(s) at specific values across a range of values and estimating all remaining parameters. A likelihood profile offers insight into model sensitivity to changing model parameter values, while providing an additional way to describe uncertainty in the parameter by indentifying the range of parameters within 1.96 likelihood units of the reference model.

The profile on the assumption of $lnR_0$, which sets the initial scale of the population) demonstrates the expected scaling up and down of the population with increasing and decreasing initial recruitment, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:R0-profile}). The likelihood profile is highly informed to the ultimate maximum likelihood estimate. The change in the current spawning output is steeper than the initial spawning output, leading to a u-shaped relationship in relative biomass. Once the $lnR_0$ approaches 7, the population approaches an overfished state. The age (all sources) and recruitment data are most supportive of a well-informed initial scale, whereas lengths (mainly the recreational data) tend to push the population very low and the index data quite high (Figure \ref{fig:R0-profile-components}).

The steepness profile showed little information content for this parameter (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile}) as the best fit value went towards the bound of 1. Changing steepness mostly changed the estimate of current stock size, especially when steepness drops below 0.7. The lower steepness values rapidly decrease the relative stock size. The likelihood components except lengths pushed the steepness to the highest value; length cause the value to race to a minimum value. (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile-components}). There seems to be no real information on the value of this parameter in this model.

The combined profile that varies female and male $M$ while maintaining the reference model offset demonstrates the model wants natural mortality values to be near the low end of reasonable natural mortlality values (Figure \ref{fig:M-multiprofile-combo}). This lowering of the stock productivity results in stock status near the overfished limit. This type of sensitivity to stock productivity (similar to what we see with the steepness profile) makes natural mortality a strong candidate for exploring model specification uncertainty in order to build alternative states of nature for decision tables.

### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model and sequentially removing one year of data up through minus 10 years. Retrospective spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}) and relatives stock status (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}) estimates show a generally consistent pattern in population scale and trend. All models show the population increasing, with the models removing the most data showing the increasing starting sooner and trending stronger upward. This results in a stock status firmly in the precautionary zone, whereas the models with more data put those same years closer to the overfished level. Some of this is due to the change in stock scale, though overall scale estimates are not strikingly different. Overall, the variation in scale and status are within the uncertainty bounds of the reference model, except the model that removes 9 and 10 years of data, which is slightly higher in both scale and stock status.
