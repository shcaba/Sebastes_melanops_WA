# Management 

## Reference Points

Unfished spawning output was measured at `r sb0` millions of eggs (Table \ref{tab:reference}) and spawning output at the beginning of `r model$endyr + 1` was estimated to be `r sb_final` millions of eggs. The stock is estimated to have dropped below the management target in the mid-1980s and below the threshold limit of 25% in the 1990s, and has increased in recent years to be above the management target (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The estimated fraction unfished is `r round(100*model$current_depletion, 1)`%, above the target reference point of 40% (Table \ref{tab:reference}).  

Recruitment has fluctuated regularly since the 1970s with a string of strong recruitments between 2003-2014 (Figure \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}). Fishing intensity, 1 - SPR, is estimated to have been above the SPR50% rate starting in 1981 and remaining above the target through 2018 (Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). The phase plot shows the interaction of fishing intensity and biomass targets (Figure \ref{fig:phase-plot}). Figure \ref{fig:yield-curve} shows the equilibrium yield curves and net production based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)`.

## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties


## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year (2025-2034) projection of the reference model with removals in 2023 and 2024 provided by the Groundfish Management Team for each fleet under the category 1 ($\sigma$=0.5) time-varying buffer using $P^*$ = 0.45 and 40-10 ACL control rule is provided in Table \ref{tab:project}.



## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The estimated uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` spawning output is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` OFL is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma,2)`. The estimated model uncertainty was less than the category 1 groundfish data moderate assessment default value of  $\sigma$ = 0.5.
