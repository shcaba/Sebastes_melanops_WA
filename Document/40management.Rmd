## Reference Points
OREGON: Spawning output declined as it tracks quickly rising recreational catches in the late 1970s, then stabilizes (Figure 151) Stock status is above the target reference point (SB40%) at 60% (59%-62% 95% asymptotic intervals; Table 45). Unfished spawning output was measured at 1385 (1212-1557 95% asymptotic intervals; Table 45) and spawning output at the beginning of 2015 was estimated to be 838 (740-936 95% asymptotic intervals). According to this model specification, there is no time in which the stock was below the target or limit reference point, but is currently pointed downward. Fishing intensity has been less than the SPR50% rate the whole time series (Figure 173). The phase plot shows the interaction of fishing intensity and biomass targets (Figure 174). The equilibrium curve is shifted left, as expected from the high fixed steepness, showing a more productive stock than SPR50% would suggest (Figure 175). The target stock size based on the biomass target (SB40%) is 554 (millions of eggs), which gives a catch of 556 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy FMSY harvest rate corresponding to SPR50% is 518 mt (Table 45).

WA: 
Spawning output declined over a large extent of the time series, with an increasing and or more stable population prevailing since the late 1980s (Figure 221) Stock status is above the target reference point (40%) at 43% (36%-50% 95% asymptotic intervals; Figure 222). Unfished spawning output was measured at 1356 (1228-1483 95% asymptotic intervals; Table 67) and spawning output at the beginning of 2015 was estimated to be 582 (467-698 95% asymptotic intervals) There seems to be no time in which the stock was below the limit reference point and has only fluctuated above the target reference point. Recruitment has fluctuated regularly over the last 25 years (Figure 223 and Figure 224). Despite being above the target biomass, fishing intensity has been above the SPR50% rate in the last couple of years (Figure 237). The phase plot shows the interaction of fishing intensity and biomass targets (Figure 238). The equilibrium curve is shifted left, as expected from the high fixed steepness, showing a more productive stock than SPR50% would suggest (Figure 239). The target stock size based on the biomass target (SB40%) is 542 (millions of eggs), which gives a catch of 337 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy FMSY harvest rate corresponding to SPR50% is 311 mt (Table 67).

From Vermilion:
Reference points were calculated using the estimated fishery selectivity and removals in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` meggs. 

The `r endyr + 1` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the `r spp` relative biomass target of 40 percent (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-SPR$, of recent years was near or above the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) for most of the 1980s and 1990s. Recent years also show near target fishing levels (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}), highlighting how the sustainability of current fishing levels are very sensitive to incoming recruitment. Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)`.


## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties


## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year (2023-2032) projection of the reference model with removals in 2021 and 2022 provided by the Groundfish Management Team for each fleet under the category 1 (sigma=0.5) time-varying buffer using $P^*$ = 0.45 and 40-10 ABC control rule is provided in Table \ref{tab:project}.



## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The estimated uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` spawning output is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` OFL is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma,2)`. The estimated model uncertainty was less than the category 1 groundfish data moderate assessment default value of  $\sigma$ = 0.5.
