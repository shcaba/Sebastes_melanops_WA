Warning 1 : Fleet:_1max bound on parameter for size at peak is 70; should be <= midsize bin N-1 (63)
Warning 2 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 3 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 3 : Minimum pop size bin:_4; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 0
Warning 4 : Minimum pop size bin:_4; is > L at Amin for sex: 2; Gpat: 1; L= 0
Warning 5 : Final gradient: 0.000927693 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 1 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
