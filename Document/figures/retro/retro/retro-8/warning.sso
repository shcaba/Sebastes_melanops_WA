Warning 1 Adjustment:  recdev_end: 2017 > retro_yr: 2014 reset 
Warning 2 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 2 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 3 : Minimum pop size bin:_4; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 0
Warning 4 : Minimum pop size bin:_4; is > L at Amin for sex: 2; Gpat: 1; L= 3.66175
Warning 5 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 7.5502e-07; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 6 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 7 : Final gradient: 2.72163 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Warning 8 : Main recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
